    <h3>Trading the engulfing bar with moving averages</h3>
    <p>Trading the engulfing bar pattern with moving averages provide a 
        very profitable trading strategy, however, the lack of knowledge about 
        using  the  moving  average  can  damage  dramatically  your  trading 
        account.<br><br>
        Traders use moving averages in different ways:<br><br>
        -As a trend following tool to identify the direction of the trend, so they 
        buy the market when prices are above 200 simple moving average. 
        And they sell the market when it is below the 200 simple moving 
        average<br><br>
        -To determine whether the market is overbought or oversold we just 
        watch how prices interact with the moving averages, for example, in 
        an uptrend, if prices move far from the moving averages, this is an 
        indication that the market is overbought.<br><br>
        -To predict the trend, change by using the crossover strategy, if the 
        moving average crosses over another, it is a signal of a trend reversal. 
        As any trading system, the moving averages have disadvantages; this 
        is why you have to know how to use it successfully under the right 
        market conditions.<br><br>
        This trading technical tool doesn’t apply to all markets, don’t never try 
        to use it in range bound or untradeable markets.<br><br>
        Because you will get lot of false signals, and you will definitively blow 
        up your trading account.<br><br>
        To the best of my knowledge, using the moving average as a dynamic 
        support and resistance in trending markets, in combination with an 
        engulfing bar pattern signal is the perfect way to make money in the 
        market.<br><br>
        The strategy is very simple, we will use the 21 and the 8-simple moving 
        averages in the daily and 4-hour time frames, we will define a clear 
        bullish or bearish market and we simply buy when price pullbacks to 
        the moving average and an engulfing bar pattern forms.<br><br>
        See the illustration below:</p>

    <p>Conversely, if the moving average is trending down, it shows that the 
        market is in a downtrend, we sell when price retrace to the moving 
        average. <br><br>
        The screenshot below shows how prices interact with the moving 
        average as dynamic resistance level, and how the engulfing bar pattern 
        represented a high probability setup.

    <h3 style="color: red;">How to trade the engulfing bar with Fibonacci retracement</h3>
    <p>Traders use Fibonacci retracement in different ways, however, the 
        most important Fibonacci retracement levels are the 50% and the 61% 
        Fibonacci retracements, knowing how to use this tool in conjunction 
        with  Japanese  candlestick  will  definitively  maximize  your  profit 
        potential.<br><br>
        According to chart technicians, the most major moves retrace around 
        50 % or 61 % Fibonacci retracement, this knowledge will provide you 
        with the ability to predict with high accuracy the next major move in a 
        trending market.<br><br>
        The strategy is very simple, you define a clear uptrend or downtrend, 
        and  then,  you  define  major  corrective  levels  by  using  Fibonacci 
        retracement tool, if you see an engulfing bar pattern matches up with 
        50% or 61 % levels, it is a powerful price action trading signal like we 
        see in the chart below:</p>
        <img src="img/79.webp"/>
    <p>In the example above, the engulfing bar price action signal matches up 
        with the 50 % and 61 % Fibonacci retracement level, the resistance 
        level that becomes support is another confirmation to take this high 
        probability setup.<br><br>
        This trading strategy is very powerful, here is another example below 
        that illustrates the power of 50% and 61 % Fibonacci retracement:</p>
        <img src="img/80.webp"/>
    <p>Trading the market from 50% and 61% Fibonacci levels means you are 
        trading from better price levels, as a result, you will put as many 
        probabilities in your favor as  possible, and that will allow you to 
        become one of the most successful traders.</p>
    <h3 style="color: red;">Trading the engulfing bar with trendlines</h3>
    <p>Trend lines give traders an idea about the psychology of the market, 
        especially, the psychology between buyers and sellers,moreover, it 
        allows  professional  traders  to  determine  whether  the  market  is 
        pessimistic or optimistic.<br><br>
        This technical trading tool is used in different ways, either as support 
        and resistance by drawing them horizontally, or to identify price and 
        time by drawing trend lines vertically. There is no wrong way in using 
        trend lines.<br><br>
        In trending markets, we use simply trend lines to highlight a trend by 
        connecting swing highs or swing lows in price; this way helps us find 
        high probability entry setups in line with the general trend of the 
        market.<br><br>
        See the illustration below:</p>
        <img src="img/81.webp"/>
    <p>By connecting the extreme highs, we had a trend line that acted as a 
        resistance level and the formation of the engulfing bar pattern shows 
        a good selling opportunity.<br><br> 
        If you used just horizontal support and resistance levels, you will miss 
        this profitable trade.<br><br>
        Learning about how to draw trend lines is never a bad idea, because it 
        is the simplest analytic tool that you can use  to analyze financial 
        markets, it works in all markets, whether it’s forex, commodities, 
        futures, or options.</p>
        <img src="img/82.webp"/>
    <P>The chart above shows a bullish trend, the trend line acts as a support 
        level, the price action signal that occurred created a great buying 
        opportunity.</P>
