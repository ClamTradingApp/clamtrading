    <h3>Trading strategies and tactics</h3>
    <p>In the last chapters you learnt three important aspects of price action 
        trading:<br><br>
       <strong>  The first aspect is the market trends:  </strong>you know how to identify the 
        market trend using multiple time frames analysis. You know how to 
        differentiate between trending markets, and range bounds markets. 
        And you understand how each market moves.<br><br>
        <strong>  The second aspect is the level: </strong> you learnt how to draw support and 
        resistance, and how to draw trend lines, this skill will help you better 
        enter the market in the right time.<br><br>
        <strong>  The third aspect is the signals: </strong> you have seen different candlestick 
        patterns, you understand the psychology behind its formation, and the 
        message they send you.<br><br>
        These three aspects which are the trend, the level, and the signal are 
        what we will use in our trading approach to make money trading any 
        financial market. <br><br>
        I mean that when you open a chart, you will try to answer three 
        important questions:<br><br>
        1-What the market is doing? Is it trending, consolidating, or is it a 
        choppy market? <br><br>
        If it is trending, you know how to identify if it is an uptrend or a 
        downtrend. <br><br>
        If it is a ranging market, you will see that it is trading horizontally 
        between two boundaries. And if it is a choppy market, you close your 
        chart and you stay away.<br><br>
        2-What are the most powerful levels in this market?<br><br>
        If the market is trending up or down, or it is ranging, you will try to find 
        the most important support and resistance levels. <br><br>
        These levels are the best zones where you can buy and sell the market. 
        3-What is the best signal to enter the market?<br><br>
        The best signal to enter the market means the right time to execute 
        your trade. <br><br>
        And this is what you will learn in the next chapter.</p>
