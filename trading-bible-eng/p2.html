    <h3>What is a candlestick?</h3>
    <p>Japanese candlesticks are formed using the open, high, low and close 
        of the chosen time frame.</p>
        <img src="img/1.webp"/>
    <p>
        -If the close is above the open, we can say that the candlestick is bullish 
    which means that the market is rising in this period of time. Bullish 
    candlesticks are always displayed as white candlestick. <br><br>
    The  most  trading  platform  use  white  color  to  refer  to  bullish 
    candlesticks. But the color doesn’t matter, you can use whatever color 
    you want. <br><br>
    The most important is the open price and the close price.
    -If the close is below the open, we can say that the candlestick is 
    bearish  which  indicates  that  the  market  is  falling  in  this  session. 
    Bearish candles are always displayed as black candlesticks. But this is 
    not a rule. <br><br>
    You can find different colors used to differentiate between bullish 
    and bearish candlesticks.<br><br>
    -The filled part of the candlestick is called the real body.<br>
    -The thin lines poking above and below the body are called shadows. <br>
    -The top of the upper shadow is the high <br>
    -The bottom of the lower shadow is the low.<br>
   <h4> Candlestick body sizes:</h4>
    Candlesticks have different body sizes:
    </p>
    <img src="img/2.webp"/>
    <p>Long bodies refer to strong buying or selling pressure, if there is a 
        candlestick in which the close is above the open with a long body, this 
        indicates that buyers are stronger and they are taking control of the 
        market during this period of time.<br><br>
        Conversely, if there is a bearish candlestick in which the open is above 
        the  close  with  a  long  body,  this  means  that  the  selling  pressure 
        controls the market during this chosen time frame.<br><br>
        -Short and small bodies indicate a little buying or selling activity.</p>
    <h3>Candlestick shadows (tails)</h3>
    <p>The upper and lower shadows give us important information about the 
        trading session.<br><br>
        -Upper shadows signify the session high <br>
        -Lower shadows signify the session low <br>
        Candlesticks with long shadows show that trading action occurred well 
        past the open and close.</p>

    <p>
        Japanese candlesticks with short shadows indicate that most of the 
        trading action was confined near the open and close.<br><br>
        -If a candlestick has a longer upper shadow, and short lower shadow, 
        this means that buyers flexed their muscles and bid price higher.<br><br>
        But for one reason or another, sellers came in and drove price back 
        down to end the session back near its open price.<br><br>
        -If a Japanese candlestick has a long lower shadow and short upper 
        shadow,  this  means  that  sellers  flashed  their  washboard  abs  and 
        forced price lower. But for one reason or another buyer came in and 
        drove prices back up to end the session back near its’ open price.
