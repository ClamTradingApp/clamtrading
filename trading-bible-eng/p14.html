    <h3>Trading pin bars with confluence</h3>
    <p>Confluence happens when many technical indicators generate the 
        same signal, this trading concept is used by price action traders to filter 
        their entry points and spot high probability signals in the market.<br><br>
        It doesn’t matter if you are beginner or advanced trader, trading with 
        confluence is a must, because it will help you focus on quality setups 
        rather than quantity, and it will enhance tremendously your trading 
        performance.<br><br>
        Confluence means combination or conjunction, it is a situation in 
        which two or more things join or come together, for example, if we are 
        looking for a pin bar signal, we need to find other factors of confluence 
        to confirm our entry; we are not going to take any pin bar that we find 
        on our chart.<br><br>
       <strong>Factors of confluence:</strong> <br><br>
        The trend: it is one of the most important factor of confluence, this is 
        the first thing that most successful traders look for on their charts, you 
        can’t  trade  any  setup  without  identifying  if  it  is  in line  with  the 
        direction of the market or not. <br><br>
        A bearish pin bar in a downtrend is more powerful signal than the one 
        in a range-bound market.<br><br>
        <strong>Support and resistance levels and supply and demand areas:</strong> these 
        major levels have a significant importance in the market, because all 
        big participants watch these specific areas.<br><br>
        <strong>Moving averages:</strong> i personally use the 8 and 21 moving average, this 
        technical trading tool acts as dynamic support and resistance, and it is 
        a very important factor of confluence in trending markets.<br><br>
        <strong>Fibonacci  retracement  tool:</strong>  I  use  the  61%  and  50  %  Fibonacci 
        retracement to find the most powerful areas in the market.</p>
    <p><strong>Trend lines:</strong> drawing these lines on your charts give us an idea about 
        the market direction and help us find the most important reversal 
        points in the market.<br><br>
        When you are analyzing your chart, you are not obligated to find all 
        these levels to determine whether the trade is valid or not. <br><br>
        If you can find just one or two factors of confluence that come up 
        together with a good pin bar setup, this is quite enough to make a 
        profitable trade.<br><br>
        <strong>For example:</strong> an obvious pin bar signal near support or resistance level 
        in line with the direction of the market.<br><br>
        See the illustration below:</p>
        <img src="img/60.webp"/>
    <p>In the example above, we have a high probability setup with four 
        factors of confluence.<br><br>
        1- The Trend: the market is trading up which means that we have to 
        follow the trend and look for a buying opportunity.<br><br>
        2-The level: The  support  level  is  an  important  key  level  in  the 
        market.as you can see, price broke out of the resistance level that 
        becomes support and pulled back to it.<br><br>
        3-The  signal:   The  formation  of   the   bullish   pin   bar   after  the 
        retracement back to the resistance level that becomes support.<br><br>
        4-Another signal: The rejection of the pin bar from the support level, 
        and the 21 moving average that acted as a dynamic support level.<br><br>
        All these factors work together to give us powerful trading signal to 
        buy the market.<br><br>
        See another example:</p>

    <h3>Pin Bars trades examples</h3>
    <p>I will give you some trading examples to help you understand how to 
        trade the pin bar candlestick pattern with the trend. and how to use 
        the confluence concept to confirm your entries.<br><br>
        See the chart below:</p>
        <img src="img/62.webp"/>
    <p>This is the NZDUSD daily chart, as you can see the market is trending 
        down. this is the first information that we gather from this chart.
        After the breakout of the support level that becomes resistance, the 
        price retraced back to this level, and formed a pin bar candlestick 
        pattern.</p>
    <p>The formation of the pin bar near the resistance level indicates that 
        the retracement move is over, and the beginning of an impulsive move 
        is likely to happen.<br><br>
        When we put the 21 moving average and the Fibonacci retracement 
        on the chart, we see that the pin bar is rejected from these levels which 
        indicates that this level is very important and sellers are willing to push 
        the market lower.<br><br>
        Here in this example we have solid reasons to sell the market, the first 
        reason is the downtrend.<br><br>
        The second reason is the formation of the pin bar near the resistance 
        level which indicates the end of the pullback and the beginning of a 
        new move downward.<br><br>
        The third reason is the rejection of the pin bar from the resistance 
        level, and from the 21-moving average,<br>
        The  last  reason  is  the  pin  bar  rejection  from the  50%  Fibonacci 
        retracement level which is considered to be one of the most powerful 
        key levels in the market.<br><br>
        Look at the chart below to see what happened next:</p>
        <img src="img/63.webp"/>
    <p>As you can see in the chart above, our analysis was right, because it 
        was based on solid reasons to enter the market.
        This is the method that i want you to learn to be able to trade the 
        market successfully. Look at another chart below:</p>
        <img src="img/64.webp"/>
    <p>The chart above shows two important buying opportunities.<br><br>
        The market was trending up, the formation of the first pin bar after the 
        retracement back to the support level was a high probability entry.
        What confirms our entry is the rejection from the 21-moving average, 
        and the 50% Fibonacci retracement.<br><br>
        The same thing happens with the second pin bar that allowed us to 
        enter the market again and make more profits.</p>
    <h3>Trading pin bars in range-bound markets</h3>
    <p>We can say that a market is ranging when prices don’t make any higher 
        high and higher low and start trading horizontally between a definable 
        level of support and a definable level of resistance.<br><br>
        Once i see that the market changes its behavior, i have to change my 
        tactics and adopt a trading strategy that fits this new market condition. 
        To confirm a ranging market, i have to look for at least two touches of 
        support level, and two touches of resistance level, and once i have 
        identified the range, then it becomes very simple to trade it by going 
        long when prices reaches the support level and going short when 
        prices approach the resistance level. <br><br>
        See below an example of a range-bound market:</p>
        <img src="img/65.webp"/>
    <p>As you see, as prices approach the key support or resistance level, we 
        have an opportunity to buy or sell the market; we need just to wait for 
        a clear price action setup such as a pin bar candlestick. <br><br>
        Look at the illustration below:</p>
        <img src="img/66.webp"/>
    <p>The illustration above shows us three trading opportunities, let me 
        explain you how you can trade them successfully:<br><br>
        1-The first one is a pin bar rejected from the support level, you can 
        place a buy order after the pin bar closes, or you wait for the market 
        to touches the 50% of the pin bar range.<br><br>
        Your stop loss should be placed above the support level, and your 
        profit target must be placed near the resistance level. <br><br>
        The risk reward of this trade is very attractive.<br><br>
        2-The second trading opportunity occurs near the support level, you 
        place a buy order after the close of the pin bar, and your stop loss 
        should  be  below  the  support  level.  your  profit  target  is  the  next 
        resistance level.</p>
    <p>3-The third setup is an obvious buying opportunity; as you can see the 
        market was rejected from the support level and formed a pin bar to 
        inform us that buyers are still there, and the market is likely to bounce 
        from the support level.<br><br>
        Trading from major key support and resistance levels is the easiest way 
        to make money trading range-bounds markets, don’t never try to 
        trade any setup if it is not strongly rejected from these areas.<br><br>
        The second strategy is about trading in the direction of the breakouts 
        of major key levels or waiting for the prices to retrace back to the 
        breakout point and then you go long or you short the market. <br><br>
        See the example below:</p>
        <img src="img/67.webp"/>
    <p>The figure above illustrates a range-bound market, the price broke out 
        of the support level and retraces back to the point of the breakout, 
        and the formation of an obvious pin bar indicates a high probability 
        signal to short the market.<br><br>
        This is how professional traders trade ranging markets based on this 
        price action signal.<br><br>
       <strong style="color: red;"> How to confirm pin bar signals using technical indicators </strong><br><br>
        Using technical indicators to confirm your entries will increase your 
        probability of the trade being profitable, i’am not telling you that you 
        have to focus on indicators to generate signals, because this will never 
        work for you, but if you can combine your price action strategies with 
        the right indicators, you will be able to filter your signals and trade the 
        best setups.<br><br>
        One of the best indicators that i use to confirm my entries when i 
        examine a range-bound market is the Bollinger bands indicator.
        This technical trading tool was developed by John Bollinger to measure 
        a market’s volatility.<br><br>
        The strategy is very simple, we will combine horizontal support and 
        resistance with the upper and lower Bollinger bands false breakout, if 
        prices are rejected from major key levels and from the bands, this is a 
        confirmation that the market will bounce from these levels. <br><br>
        See an example below:</p>
        <img src="img/68.webp"/>
    <p>If you look at the chart above, you will notice how the Bollinger bands 
        act as a dynamic support and resistance, when the market approaches 
        the upper or the lower bands, prices bounce strongly. <br><br>
        So if we see that a pin bar is rejected from a horizontal key level and 
        from bands, this is a clear confirmation to buy or sell the market.<br><br>
        This confirmation strategy is very simple, and it will help you decide 
        whether to take a trade or ignore it, because trading is all about 
        emotions, and sometimes, you will spot a nice pin bar signal in a range 
        bound market, but you will find it difficult to make a decision.<br><br>
        What you have to do in this case is simple, just put your Bollinger bands 
        on your chart, and if you see that the signal is rejected from horizontal 
        levels and from the bands, don’t over thinking about what you should 
        do next. <br><br>
        Just execute your trade, place your stop loss and profit target then stay 
        away and let the market do the work for you.<br><br>
        See another illustration below:</p>
        <img src="img/69.webp"/>
    <p>The  daily  chart  above  shows  us  how  this  indicator  could  help  us 
        execute  our  trades  with  confidence;  the  false  breakout  of  the 
        resistance level that was made by the pin bar was a powerful signal to 
        short the market. The trade was confirmed by the false breakout of 
        the upper band as well.<br><br>
        Remember that this technical indicator is used just as a confirmation 
        tool in range-bound markets, don’t use it to generate signals, use it 
        always in combination with horizontal key levels, and you will see how 
        this strategy will affect positively your trading account.<br><br>
        In conclusion, i recommend you to practice these strategies as much 
        as you can before you open and fund your trading account.</p>
