    <p>If  you  can  easily  identify  these  candlestick  patterns,  and  you

        learning about them again till you feel like you master them.</p>
    <p>Let’s try to answer the questions concerning the candlestick patterns 
        on the charts above:<br><br>
        1: Bullish Harami pattern (inside bar)<br>
        -The formation of this candlestick patterns indicates indecision in the 
        market, in other  words, the  market was  consolidating during  this 
        session.<br><br>
        2: Bullish Tweezers<br>
        The market was trading up, sellers tried to push the market lower, but 
        the reaction of buyers was more powerful. <br>
        This pattern represents the battle between sellers and buyers to take 
        control of the market.<br><br>
        3: Engulfing bar<br>
        -Sellers were engulfed by buyers, this indicates that buyers are still 
        willing to push the market higher.<br><br>
        4: Engulfing bar <br>
        5: Engulfing bar <br>
        6: Engulfing bar <br>
        7: Harami pattern<br>
        This pattern shows us that the market enters in a consolidation phase 
        during this session.so buyers and sellers are in an indecision period. 
        And no one knows who is going to be in control of the market.</p>

        out these candlestick patterns:</p>
