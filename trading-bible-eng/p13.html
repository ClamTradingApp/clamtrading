    <h3>Trading the pin bar candlestick with the trend</h3>
    <p>If you are a beginner trader, i highly recommend you to stick with the 
        trend, because pin bars that occur in trending markets offer good 
        trading opportunities with high risk/reward ratio.<br><br>
        When you master trading it with the rend, you can then move to trade 
        range-bounds markets or even counter-trends.<br><br>
        This strategy is simple, you start by identifying a clear uptrend or 
        downtrend, and you wait for a pin bar to occur after a pullback to 
        support or resistance level. <br><br>
        See the example below:</p>
    <img src="img/53.webp"/>
    <p>The figure below shows how this price action signal works if it is traded 
        with  the  trend,  as  you  can  see,  the  price  was  rejected  from  the 
        resistance level which indicates that the bears are still in charge of the 
        downtrend.<br><br>
        The formation of the pin bar indicates the end of the retracement 
        move, and the beginning of the impulsive move at the resistance level 
        in line with the downtrend.<br><br>
        This  is  a  high-quality  setup  because  all  the  following  criteria  are 
        respected:</p>
    <p>1-The pin bar is well formed, and it is in line with the direction of the 
        market.<br><br>
        2-The rejection occurred in a major key level which represents a hot 
        point in the market (resistance level).<br><br>
        3-The risk to reward ratio is good, and it is worth trading. 
        Sometimes, even if the market is trending, we can’t draw support and 
        resistance levels, because prices move in a certain way which we can’t 
        spot static key levels. <br><br>
        If you are in this situation, you can use the 21-moving average which 
        will act as a dynamic support in an uptrend market and a dynamic 
        resistance in a downtrend market. <br><br>
        See the illustration below:</p>
    <img src="img/55.webp"/>
    <p>As you can see in the chart above, the market was trending down, 
        using the 21 moving averages helps us to identify dynamic resistance 
        levels, and high probability pin bar setups. See another chart below:</p>
    <img src="img/56.webp"/>
    <p>The 4-hour chart above illustrates how the 21-moving average could 
        help us find key points in the market. <br><br>
        When prices approach the moving average, the buying pressure takes 
        place in the market, and the price goes up.<br><br>
        The pin bar signal is clear on the chart, because the trend is bullish, the 
        price action setup has a bullish anatomy as well, and the rejection from 
        the 21-moving average is a confirmation signal to buy the market.</p>
    <h3>Trading tactics</h3>
    <p>When we identify the trend, (uptrend or downtrend) and the level 
        (support or resistance).<br><br>
        And we find a pin bar near these levels in line with the direction of the 
        trend. The second step is to know how to enter the market based on 
        this candlestick pattern.<br><br>
        According to my experience, there are different entry options when it 
        comes to trading pin bars; it all depends on the candle anatomy, the 
        market conditions, and your money management strategy.<br><br>
        1-The aggressive entry option: this method consists of entering the 
        market immediately after the pin bar closes without waiting for a 
        confirmation.<br><br>
        This strategy will help you catch the move from the beginning, because 
        sometimes the price goes higher after the close of the pin bar, and if 
        you are not in the market, the trade will leave without you.<br><br>
        See the example below:</p>
    <img src="img/57.webp"/>
    <p>The chart above shows how an aggressive entry could help you to 
        execute your trade in the right time without being left by the market. 
        And as you see, we took this trade because we had three important 
        elements:<br><br>
       <strong> -The trend:</strong> The market was trending down, in this case we look for 
        selling opportunities.<br><br>
        <strong> The level:</strong> In this chart we had a support level that becomes resistance. <br><br>
        <strong> The signal:</strong> A clear pin bar was formed after the retracement back to 
        the resistance level.<br><br>
        When you have these three elements in the market, you just place 
        your trade after the close of the pin bar, and your stop loss above the 
        long tail. your profit target will be the next support level in case of a 
        downtrend.<br><br>
        These three elements are quite enough for you to find high probability 
        entries in the market.<br><br>
        <strong>The conservative entry option:</strong> this strategy consists of entering the 
        market after 50% of the range bar retracement.<br><br>
        This strategy sometimes will work and it gives you more than 5:1 
        risk/reward ratio, and sometimes the market will leave without you. <br><br>
        See the illustration below:</p>
    <img src="img/58.webp"/>
    <p>The illustration above gives us an idea about the power of conservative 
        entries, as you can see, this entry method helps us decrease our risks 
        and increase our rewards. <br><br>
        The trade above has more than 5:1 risk/reward ratio. One trade like 
        this every month is quite enough to generate a decent income. See 
        another chart below:</p>
    <img src="img/59.webp"/>
    <p>One  of  the  drawbacks  of  this  entry  option  is  that  the  market 
        sometimes doesn’t retrace to 50% of the range bar, which will make 
        you feel frustrated because the market will move to the profit target 
        without you.<br><br>
        There is no wrong or right entry option, the both work great, but with 
        screen time and experience, you will be able to decide whether to 
        trade aggressively or conservatively.</p>
