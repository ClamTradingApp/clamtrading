    <h3>How to trade the false breakout of the inside bar candlestick 
        pattern?</h3>
    <p>Have you ever placed an order with confidence thinking that the 
        market is going to go up, but price hints your stop loss before it starts 
        turning out to your predicted direction?? I have been a victim of stop 
        hunting, and i was very disappointed, but that happens several times 
        in the market.<br><br>
        Banks and financial institutions know how we trade the market, they 
        know how we think, and where we put our stop losses and profit 
        targets, this is the reason why they could easily take money from us.
        One of the most famous strategies that big players use to take money 
        from novice traders is called stop loss hunting strategy.<br><br>
        This strategy consists of driving prices to a certain level where there 
        are massive stop loss orders, and the purpose is to create liquidity, 
        because without liquidity, the market will not move. <br><br>
        Once stop losses are hunt, the market goes strongly in the predicted 
        direction.<br><br>
        The interaction between big participants and novice traders create 
        repetitive  patterns  in  the  market,  one  of  the  most  important 
        candlestick  pattern  that  illustrates  how  big  financial  institutions 
        manipulate the market is the inside bar false breakout pattern.<br><br>
        Your understanding of this repetitive setup and your ability to detect 
        it on your charts will help you better exploit it to make money instead 
        of being a victim of market makers and banks manipulations.<br><br>
        This price action signal is formed when price breaks out from the inside 
        bar pattern and then quickly reverses to close within the range of the 
        mother bar. <br><br>
        See the illustration below:</p>
        <img src="img/97.webp"/>
        <img src="img/98.webp"/>
    <p>As you can see, there are two types of this price action pattern:<br>
        A bullish inside bar false breakout that forms when the market is 
        trending down and it is also considered as a bullish reversal signal 
        when it is formed near a key support or resistance level.<br><br>
        A bearish inside bar false breakout that occurs in a bullish trend and it 
        is seen as a bearish reversal pattern when it is found near an important 
        level in the market.<br><br>
        This setup can be considered as a continuation pattern if it is traded 
        with the trend.</p>
    <h3>Inside Bars false breakouts trading examples</h3>
        <P>In my own experience, the most important levels that traders should 
            look for to trade this signal are the following:<br><br>
            -Support and resistance levels, and supply and demand areas 
            -Fibonacci   retracement   levels,   particularly,   the   50%   and   61% 
            retracement levels.<br><br>
            -21 moving averages and trend lines in trending markets <br><br>
            -Horizontal levels in range-bound markets<br><br>
            Here is an example of how to trade inside bar false breakout in a 
            trending market:</P>
            <img src="img/99.webp"/>
    <p>As you see in the chart above, the market was trending down, that 
        indicates that sellers are in control of the market, so if you decide to </p>
    <p>sell the market near the resistance level, all probabilities will be in your 
        favor.<br><br>
        But the question is when to enter the market? And where to put my 
        stop loss?<br><br>
        If you enter the market aggressively before the breakout of the mother 
        candle, and you put your stop loss above it, the market will take your 
        stop loss and go in the predicted direction.<br><br>
        See the illustration below:</p>
        <img src="img/100.webp"/>
    <p>As illustrated above, big players hunt novice traders stops before 
        pushing  the  market  to  go  down,  if  your  stop  loss  was  near  the 
        resistance level, you would be out as well, if you don’t understand the 
        reason why, it is simply because you were a victim of big players 
        hunting stop strategy.

        <p>As it is illustrated above, the inside bar false breakout gave us a good 
            selling opportunity.
            If  you  are  able  to  identify  this  setup,  and  you  understand  the 
            psychology behind it, there should be no reason not to get into the 
            position.</p>
    <h3 style="color: red;">Trading inside bar false breakouts with Fibonacci retracements</h3>
    <p>I don’t really know if you are familiar with this technical trading tool, 
        however, I will try to show you how to use it in a simple and efficient 
        way in combination with the inside bar false breakout.<br><br>
        What you have to know is that in an uptrend or a downtrend, the 
        market creates impulsive moves and pullbacks. <br><br>
        The  Fibonacci  retracement  helps  us  highlight  the  most  important 
        pullbacks levels in the market.<br><br>
        The best Fibonacci retracement levels  that i personally use are the 
        50% and 61% levels, according to my experience these levels are the 
        most important areas that experienced trader watch in their charts.<br><br>
        Our strategy is simple, we select the technical tool on our chart, and if 
        the market moves strongly, we wait for retracements, if the pullback 
        reaches 50% or 61 % levels, we need just a price action signal to 
        confirm our entry. See the example below:</p>
        <img src="img/102.webp"/></p>
    <P>By adding this technical trading tool to your strategy, you will be able 
        to identify potential trade set-ups in the market, if you analyzed the 
        chart above without using it, you wouldn’t know the reason why the 
        market dropped after the pullback.<br><br>
        Fibonacci tool can be used to trade the pin bar, the inside bar and the 
        engulfing bar setup as it was discussed in pervious sections.<br><br>
        The trade above is very profitable because there are lots of factors of 
        confluence that encourage us to place a sell order.<br><br>
        The first reason is the trend, it is obviously down, the second reason is 
        the key Fibonacci ratios that represent a resistance level, and the third 
        one is the inside bar false breakout.<br><br>
        One signal is not quite enough to make a good trading decision, you 
        have to look for multiple triggers that support your analysis, this way, 
        you will put the odds of success in your favor.<br><br>
        Look at another potential trade below:</P>
        <img src="img/103.webp"/></p>
        <p>As you can see, the price moved higher, pulled back to reach our key 
            ratios, and then continue higher. The formation of the inside bar false 
            breakout  in  this  area  indicates  that  the  pullback  has finished  and 
            another strong move will take place.<br><br>
            Understanding the market structure is very important to know how to 
            use this strategy in your advantage, if the market is trending, you can 
            trade the inside bar false breakout as we discussed before. <br><br>
            But if the market is ranging, you have to change your tactic. <br><br>
            See the illustration below:</p>
            <img src="img/104.webp"/></p>
        <p>In the chart above, the market is trading between horizontal support 
            and resistance levels, as you see if you had entered as soon as the
            market breaks out from the inside bar and the resistance level, you will 
            be caught in a false breakout.<br><br>
            The false breakout has formed because amateurs tried to predict the 
            breakout of the inside bar and the horizontal level early to pick the top, 
            but the market fake them out and formed a bull trap.<br><br>
            If you find this pattern in your chart, and you understand that buyers 
            were trapped by sellers, take this trade without hesitation, because it 
            is very profitable and it has a good risk/reward.<br><br>
            You place a selling order after the close of the break bar, and you set 
            your stop loss above it, your profit target is the next support level.
            This strategy is not complicated, but it requires time and practice to 
            master it, bear in mind that a false breakout doesn’t happen every 
            time, and not all false breakouts are worth trading.<br><br>
           <strong>The  benefits  of  trading  the  false  breakout  of  the  inside  bar 
            candlestick pattern:</strong> <br><br>
            If you master trading this pattern, this will allow to stay away from 
            trapped traders and enter the market when novice traders have to get 
            out with a loss.<br><br>
            This strategy is not a holy grail, you have to be prepared to accept 
            some losing trades, but what is interesting about it, is that the risk 
            reward  of  this  signal  has  a  great  potential,  because  when  big 
            participants surprises amateurs and take their money,  the market 
            moves very strongly, and if you can analyze correctly what happened, 
            you will enter in the right time and make big profits. Imagine risking 
            say 50 points for 400 points profits.<br><br>
            Using this price action strategy will help you predict proper turning 
            points  in  the  market  in  advance  and  understand  how  banks  and 
            financial institutions trade the market.</p>
