    <h3>The market structure</h3>
    <p>One of the most important skill that you need as a trader is the ability 
        to read the market structure, it is a critical skill that will allow you to 
        use the right price action strategies in the right market condition.<br><br>
        You are not going to trade all the markets the same way; you need to 
        study how the markets move, and how traders behave in the market. 
        The market structure is the study of the market behavior. <br><br>
        And if you can master this skill, when you open your chart, you will be 
        able to answer these important questions:<br><br>
        What the crowds are doing? Who is in control of the market buyers or 
        sellers? What is the right time and place to enter or to exit the market 
        and when you need to stay away? <br><br>
        Through your price action analysis, you will experience three types of 
        markets, trending markets, ranging markets, and choppy markets.<br>
        In this chapter, you will learn how to identify every market, and how 
        to trade it.<br>
       <h4 style="color: red;"> 1-Trending markets </h4>
        Trending markets are simply characterized by a repeating pattern of 
        higher highs and higher low in an up-trending market, and lower high 
        and lower low in a down trending market. <br><br>
        See the example below:</p>
        <img src="img/28.webp"/>
        <p>As you can see in the example above, the market is making series of 
            higher highs and higher lows which indicates that the market is up 
            trending. <br><br>
            You don’t need indicators to decide if it is bullish or bearish just a visual 
            observation of price action is quite enough to get an idea about the 
            market trend.<br><br>
            Look another example of a downtrend market.</p>
            <img src="img/29.webp"/>
        <p>The example above shows a bearish market, as you can see there are 
            series  of  higher  lows  and  lower  low  which  indicate  an  obvious 
            downtrend.<br><br>
            Trending markets are easy to identify, don’t try to complicate your 
            analysis, use your brain and see what the market is doing.<br><br>
            If it is doing series of higher highs and higher low, it is simply an 
            uptrend market; conversely, if it is making series of lower highs and 
            lower low, it is obviously a downtrend market.<br><br>
            -According to statistics, trends are estimated to occur 30% of the time, 
            so while they are in motion, you've got to know how to take advantage 
            of them.<br><br>
            -To determine whether a market is trending or not, you have to use 
            bigger time frames such the 4H, the daily or the weekly time frame. 
            Never  try  to  use  smaller  time  frames  to  determine  the  market 
            structure.</p>
