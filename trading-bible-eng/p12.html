    <h3>The pin bar candlestick pattern strategy</h3>
    <p>The pin  bar  candlestick is  one  of  the  most  famous  Japanese 
        candlesticks; it is widely used by price action traders to determine 
        reversal points in the market. <br><br>
        In this section, you will learn in detail how to identify potential pin bar 
        signals, and the conditions needed for high probability setups.
        A pin bar is a chart candlestick, it is characterized by a very long tail 
        that shows rejection and indicates that the market will move in the 
        opposite direction. <br><br>
        The area between the open and close is called the real body, typically 
        all pin bars have a very small real body and a long shadow.<br><br>
        A Bullish pin bar is known for its lower wicks, and the bearish one is 
        characterized by long upper wicks, the color of the candlestick is not 
        quite important, however, bullish candles with white real body are 
        more powerful than candles with a real black body. <br><br>
        On the other hand, a bearish pin bars with black real bodies are more 
        important than the ones with white real bodies. <br><br>

    <h3>How to identify pin bar candlestick setups?</h3>
    <p>To be honest, quality price action setups don’t exist in the market, 
        because you will see that sometimes you can find a high probability
        setup, you feel very excited about it and you take your trade with 
        confidence, but at the end, you will be frustrated because the signal 
        fails for unknown reasons.<br><br>
        That happens a couple of times, because the market doesn’t move due 
        to pin bar formations, what moves the market is the law of supply and 
        demand.<br><br>
        Let me give you an example, if you identify a quality pin bar candle 
        near a support key level in an uptrend market, this is a powerful buying 
        signal to take, you shouldn’t ignore it, but if the amount of money that 
        buyers put in this trade is less than the amount of money that sellers</p>
    <p>risk  in  the  same  trade,  the  market  will  not  go  in  your  predicted 
        direction.<br><br>
        If the signal fails, it doesn’t mean that your analysis is wrong, or pin 
        bars don’t work, it is just because the market didn’t validate your 
        decision, therefore, you accept your loss, and you look for another 
        opportunity.<br><br>
        You May ask yourself, why should we look for quality pin bar setups 
        if the market doesn’t respect them???<br><br>
        As you know, trading is a game of probabilities, there is no certainty, 
        this is why you should evaluate your pin bar setups from multiple 
        angles, and the fact that you are looking for quality setups means that 
        you are trying to put the probabilities of success in your favor which is 
        the right mindset of successful traders.<br><br>
        To determine whether or not a pin bar is worth trading, this price 
        action signal should respect the following criteria:<br><br>
        -The pin bar formed in bigger time frames such as the 4 hour or daily 
        time frame should be taken into consideration, because if you look at 
        smaller time frames, you can easily spot lot of pin bar signals, these 
        setups should be ignored, because smaller time frames generate lot of 
        false signals.<br><br> See the illustration below:</p>
    <img src="img/50.webp"/>
    <p>-The pin bar formed in line with the direction of the market is more 
        powerful than the one which is formed against the trend.<br><br>
        - If you can identify a clear trend that means that you know who is in 
        control of the market. <br><br>
        The formation of this candlestick pattern with the trend makes it so 
        effective. <br><br>See the chart below:</p>
    <img src="img/51.webp"/>
    <p>As you can see in the chart above, bullish pin bars that were formed in 
        line  with  the  uptrend  work,  and  they  should  be  taken  into 
        consideration. <br><br>
        But the bearish ones that were formed against the trend should be 
        ignored.<br><br>
        -The anatomy of a pin bar is important as well, you have to make sure 
        that the candlestick is a pin bar by looking at the distance between the 
        real body and the tail.<br><br> 
        Pin bars with longer tails are more powerful. <br><br>
        The Psychology behind the pin bar candle formation:<br><br>
        Pin bars are formed when prices are rejected, this rejection doesn’t 
        indicate a reversal signal, because this price action setup can form 
        everywhere in your chart. <br><br>
        The most important areas to watch when trading pin bars are major 
        key levels such as: support and resistance, supply and demand zones, 
        and moving averages.<br><br>
        The formation of this candlestick chart pattern in these levels give a 
        clear idea about what happens in the market.<br><br>
        If the rejection was near a support level for example, this is an obvious 
        indication that the bulls are more powerful, and they are willing to 
        push the market to go upward.<br><br>
        See the chart below:</p>

    <p>If the formation of this candlestick occurs near a resistance level, it 
        indicates that the bears reject prices, and prevent  the bulls from 
        breaking this level. So, this means that sellers are willing to push the 
        market downward. See the chart below:</p>

    <p>If you understand the psychology behind this price action  pattern 
        formation, you will be able to predict what is likely to happen in the 
        future, and you will make good trades based on high probability pin 
        bar signals.</p>
