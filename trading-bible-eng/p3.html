    <h3>Candlestick patterns</h3>
    <p>
        Candlestick patterns are one of the most powerful trading concepts, 
        they are simple, easy to identify, and very profitable setups, a research 
        has confirmed that candlestick patterns have a high predictive value 
        and can produce positive results.<br><br>
        I personally trade candlestick pattern for more than 20 years; i can’t 
        really  switch  to  another  method,  because i tried  thousands  of 
        strategies and trading methods with no results.<br><br>
        I’m not going to introduce you to a holy grail, this trading system 
        works, but be prepared to lose some trades, losing is a part of this 
        game, if you are looking for a 100% wining system, i highly recommend 
        you to stop trading and go look for another business. <br><br>
        Candlestick patterns are the language of the market, imagine you are 
        living in a foreign country, and you don’t speak the language.<br> <br>
        How could you live if you can’t even say a word? It’s tough right???The 
        same thing when it comes to trading. <br><br>
        If you know how to read candlestick patterns the right way, you will be 
        able to understand what these patterns tell you about the market 
        dynamics and the trader’s behavior. <br><br>
        This skill will help you better enter and exit the market in the right 
        time. <br><br>
        In other words, this will help you act differently in the market and 
        make money following the smart guy’s footprints.<br><br>
        The candlestick patterns that i’m going to show you here are the most 
        important patterns that you will find in the market, in this chapter, i’m 
        not  going  to  show  you  how  to  trade  them,  because  this  will  be 
        explained in details in the next chapters.<br><br>
        What i want you to do is to focus on the anatomy of the pattern and 
        the psychology behind its formation, because this will help you get the
        skill  of  identifying  easily  any  pattern  you  find  in  the  market  and 
        understand what it tells you to do next. <br><br>
        If you can get this skill, you will be ready to understand and master the 
        trading strategies and tactics that i’m going to teach you in the next 
        chapters.

    <h3 style="color: red;">The engulfing bar candlestick pattern</h3>
    <p>The Engulfing bar as it states in its title is formed when it fully engulfs 
        the previous candle. The engulfing bar can engulf more than one 
        previous candle, but to be considered an engulfing bar, at least one 
        candle must be fully consumed.<br><br>
        The  bearish  engulfing  is  one  of  the  most  important  candlestick 
        patterns. <br><br>
        This candlestick pattern consists of two bodies:<br>
        The first body is smaller than the second one, in other words, the 
        second body engulfs the previous one. See the illustration below:</p>
    <img src="img/4.webp"/>
    <p>This is how a bearish engulfing bar pattern looks like on your charts, 
        this candlestick pattern gives us valuable information about bulls and 
        bears in the market.</p>
    <p>
        In case of a bearish engulfing bar, this pattern tells us that sellers are 
        in control of the market.<br><br>
        When this pattern occurs at the end of an uptrend, this indicates that 
        buyers are engulfed by sellers which signals a trend reversal.<br><br>
        See the example below:
    </p>
    <img src="img/5.webp"/>
    <p>
        As you can see when this price action pattern occurs in an uptrend, we 
        can anticipate a trend reversal because buyers are not still in control 
        of the market, and sellers are trying to push the market to go down.<br><br>
        You can’t trade any bearish candlestick pattern you find on your chart; 
        you will need other technical tools to confirm your entries.<br><br>
        We will talk about this in details in the next chapters. Right now, i just 
        want you to open your charts and try to identify all bearish candlestick 
        patterns that you find.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: red;">The bullish engulfing bar pattern</h3>
    <p> 
        The bullish engulfing bar consists of two candlesticks, the first one is 
        the small body, and the second is the engulfing candle, <br><br>
        see the illustration:
    </p>
    <img src="img/6.webp"/>
    <p>
        The bullish engulfing bar pattern tells us that the market is no longer 
        under control of sellers, and buyers will take control of the market. <br><br>
        When a bullish engulfing candle forms in the context of an uptrend, it 
        indicates a continuation signal.<br><br>
        When a bullish engulfing candle forms at the end of a downtrend, the 
        reversal is much more powerful as it represents a capitulation bottom. <br><br>
        See the example below:
        <img src="img/7.webp"/>
    </p>
    <p>The example above shows us clearly how the market changes direction 
        after the formation of a bullish engulfing bar pattern. <br><br>
        The smaller body that represents the selling power was covered by the 
        second body that represents the buying power.<br><br>
        The color of the bodies is not important. What’s important is that the 
        smaller one is totally engulfed by the second candlestick. <br><br>
        Don’t try to trade the market using this price action setup alone, 
        because you will need other factors of confluence to decide whether 
        the pattern is worth trading or not, i will talk about this in the next 
        chapters.<br><br>
        What i want you to do now is to get the skill of identifying bearish and 
        bullish engulfing bar on your charts. This is the most important step 
        for the moment.</p>
        <h3 style="color: red;">The Doji Candlestick pattern</h3>

        <p>Doji is one of the most important Japanese candlestick patterns, when 
            this candlestick forms, it tells us that the market opens and closes at 
            the same price which means that there is equality and indecision 
            between buyers and sellers, there is no one in control of the market. <br><br>
            See the example below:</p>
            <img src="img/8.webp"/>
        <p>
            As you can see the opening price is the same as the closing price, this 
            signal means that the market didn’t decide which direction will take. 
            When this pattern occurs in an uptrend or a downtrend, it indicates 
            that the market is likely to reverse. <br><br>
            See another example below to learn more:
            <img src="img/9.webp"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            The chart above shows how the market changed direction after the 
            formation of the Doji candlestick.<br><br>
            The market was trending up, that means that buyers were in control 
            of the market. <br><br>
            The formation of the Doji candlestick indicates that buyers are unable 
            to keep price higher, and sellers push prices back to the opening price.
            This is a clear indication that a trend reversal is likely to happen. <br><br>
            Remember always that a Doji indicates equality and indecision in the 
            market, you will often find it during periods of resting after big moves 
            higher or lower. <br><br>
            When it is found at the bottom or at the top of a trend, it is considered 
            as a sign that a prior trend is losing its strengths.<br><br>
            So if you are already riding that trend it’s time to take profits, it can 
            also be used as an entry signal if it is combined with other technical 
            analysis
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: red;">The Dragonfly Doji pattern</h3>
        <p>The Dragonfly Doji is a bullish candlestick pattern which is formed 
            when the open high and close are the same or about the same price.<br><br> 
            What characterizes the dragonfly Doji is the long lower tail that shows 
            the resistance of buyers and their attempt to push the market up. <br><br>
            See the example below:</p>
        <img src="img/10.webp"/>
        <p>
            The illustration above shows us a prefect dragonfly Doji. The long 
            lower tail suggests that the forces of supply and demand are nearing a 
            balance and that the direction of the trend may be nearing a major 
            turning point. <br><br>
            See the example below that indicates a bullish reversal signal created 
            by a dragonfly Doji.
            <img src="img/11.webp"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the chart above, the market was testing the previous support level 
            that caused a strong rejection from this area. <br><br>
            The formation of the dragonfly Doji with the long lower tail shows us 
            that there is a high buying pressure in the area.<br><br>
            If you can identify this candlestick pattern on your chart, it will help 
            you visually see when support and demand are located. <br><br>
            When it occurs in a downtrend, it is interpreted as a bullish reversal 
            signal. <br><br>
            But as i always say, you can’t trade candlestick pattern alone, you will 
            need  other  indicators and  tools  to  determine  high  probability 
            dragonfly Doji signals in the market.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: red;">The Gravestone Doji</h3>
        <p>The Gravestone Doji is the bearish version of the dragonfly Doji, it is 
            formed when the open and close are the same or about the same 
            price.<br><br>
            What differentiates the Gravestone Doji from the dragonfly Doji is the 
            long upper tail. <br><br>
            The formation of the long upper tail is an indication that the market is 
            testing a powerful supply or resistance area. <br><br>
            See the example below:</p>
            <img src="img/12.webp"/>
         <p>
             The image above illustrates a perfect gravestone Doji. This pattern 
             indicates that while buyers were able to push prices well above the 
             open.<br><br>
             Later in the day sellers overwhelmed the market pushing the price 
             back down. <br><br>
             This is interpreted as a sign that bulls are losing their momentum and 
             the market is ready for a reversal. <br><br>
             See another illustration below:
             <img src="img/13.webp"/>
             The chart above shows a gravestone Doji at the top of an uptrend, 
            after a period of strong bullish activity. <br><br>
            The formation of this candlestick pattern indicates that buyers are no 
            longer in control of the market. For this pattern to be reliable, 
            it must occur near a resistance level.<br><br>
            As a trader, you will need additional information about the placement 
            and context of the gravestone Doji to interpret the signal effectively. 
            This is what i will teach you in the next chapters. 
         </p>
         <h3 style="color: red;">The morning star</h3>
         <img src="img/14.webp"/>
         <p>
            The morning star pattern is considered as a bullish reversal pattern, it 
            often occurs at the bottom of a downtrend and it consists of three 
            candlesticks:<br><br>
            -The first candlestick is bearish which indicates that sellers are still in 
            charge of the market.<br><br>
            -The second candle is a small one which represents that sellers are in 
            control, but they don’t push the market much lower and this candle 
            can be bullish or bearish.<br><br>
            -The third candle is a bullish candlestick that gapped up on the open 
            and  closed  above  the  midpoint  of  the  body  of  the  first  day,  this 
            candlestick holds a significant trend reversal signal.<br><br>
            The morning star pattern shows us how buyers took control of the 
            market  from  sellers,  when  this  pattern  occurs  at  the  bottom  of 
            downtrend near a support level, it is interpreted as a powerful trend 
            reversal signal. <br><br>
            See the illustration below:
            <img src="img/15.webp"/>
            The chart above helps us identify the morning star pattern and how it 
            is significant when it is formed at the bottom of a downtrend. <br><br>
            As you can see the pattern occurred at an obvious bearish trend. <br><br>
            The first candle confirmed the seller’s domination, and the second one 
            produces indecision in the market, the second candle could be a Doji, 
            or any other candle. <br><br>
            But here, the Doji candle indicated that sellers are struggling to push 
            the market lower. The third bullish candle indicates that buyers took 
            control from sellers, and the market is likely to reverse.<br><br>
            This  is  how  professional  traders  analyze  the  market  based  on 
            candlestick patterns, and this is how you will analyze financial markets 
            if  you  can  master  the  anatomy  of  candlestick  patterns  and  the 
            psychology behind their formations.
         </p>
         <h3 style="color: redd;">The evening star pattern</h3>
         <p>
            The evening star pattern is considered as a bearish reversal pattern 
            that usually occurs at the top of an uptrend. <br><br>
            The pattern consists of three candlesticks: <br><br>
            -The first candle is a bullish candle <br><br>
            -The second candle is a small candlestick, it can be bullish or bearish or 
            it can be a Doji or any other candlestick.<br><br>
            -The third candle is a large bearish candle. In general, the evening star 
            pattern is the bearish version of the morning star pattern.<br><br>
            See the example below:
            <img src="img/16.webp"/>
         </p>
         <p>The first part of an evening star is a bullish candle; this means that bulls 
            are still pushing the market higher. <br><br>
            Right now, everything is going all right. The formation of the smaller 
            body shows that buyers are still in control but they are not as powerful 
            as they were. <br><br>
            The third bearish candle indicates that the buyer’s domination is over, 
            and a possible bearish trend reversal is likely to happen. <br><br>
            See another chart that illustrates how the evening star could represent 
            a significant trend reversal signal.
            <img src="img/17.webp"/>
            As you can see the market was trending up, the first candle in the 
            pattern indicates a long move up. <br><br>
            The second one is a short candle indicating price consolidation and 
            indecision. <br><br>
            In other words, the trend that created the first long bullish 
            candlestick is losing momentum. The final candlestick gaping lower 
            than the previous candlestick indicating a confirmation of the 
            reversal and the beginning of a new trend down.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: red;">The Hammer (pin bar)</h3>
        <p>The Hammer candlestick is created when the open high and close are 
            roughly the same price; it is also characterized by a long lower shadow 
            that indicates a bullish rejection from buyers and their intention to 
            push the market higher. <br><br>
            See the illustration below to see how it looks like:</p>
        <img src="img/18.webp"/>
        <p>
            The hammer is a reversal candlestick pattern when it occurs at the 
            bottom of a downtrend.<br><br>
            This candle forms when sellers push the market lower after the open, 
            but they get rejected by buyers so the market closes higher than the 
            lowest price.<br><br>
            See another example below:
            <img src="img/19.webp"/>
        </p>
        <P>
            As you can see the market was trending down, the formation of the 
            hammer (pin bar) was a significant reversal pattern. <br><br>
            The long shadow represents the high buying pressure from this point. 
            Sellers was trying to push the market lower, but in that level the buying 
            power was more powerful than the selling pressure which results in a 
            trend reversal. <br><br>
            The  most  important  to  understand  is  the  psychology  behind  the 
            formation of this pattern, if you can understand how and why it was 
            created, you will be able to predict the market direction with high 
            accuracy. <br><br>
            We will talk about how to trade this pattern and how to filter this signal 
            in the next chapters.
        </P>
        <h3 style="color: red;">The shooting star (bearish pin bar)</h3>
        <p>
            The shooting formation is formed when the open low, and close are 
            roughly the same price, this candle is characterized by a small body
            and a long upper shadow. It is the bearish version of the hammer. <br><br>
            Professional technicians say that the shadow should be twice the 
            length of the real body. <br><br>
            See the example below:
            <img src="img/20.webp"/>
            The illustration above shows us a perfect shooting star with a real small 
            body  and  an  upper  long  shadow,  when  this  pattern  occurs  in  an 
            uptrend; it indicates a bearish reversal signal. <br><br>
            The psychology behind the formation of this pattern is that buyers try 
            to push the market higher, but they got rejected by a selling pressure.<br><br>
            When this candlestick forms near a resistance level. It should be taken 
            as a high probability setup. <br><br>
            See another example below:
            <img src="img/21.webp"/>
            The chart above shows a nice shooting star at the end of an uptrend. 
            The formation of this pattern indicates the end of the uptrend move, 
            and the beginning of a new downtrend.<br><br>
            This candlestick pattern can be used with support and resistance, 
            supply and demand areas, and with technical indicators.<br><br>
            The shooting star is very easy to identify, and it is very profitable, it is 
            one of the most powerful signals that i use to enter the market.<br><br>
            In the next chapters, i will talk about it in details, and i will show you 
            step by step how to make money trading this price action pattern.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: red;">The Harami Pattern (the inside bar)</h3>
        <p>The Harami pattern (pregnant in Japanese) is considered as a reversal 
            and continuation pattern, and it consists of two candlesticks:<br><br>
            The first candle is the large candle, it is called the mother candle, 
            followed by a smaller candle which is called the baby.<br><br>
            For the Harami pattern to be valid, the second candle should close 
            outside the previous one. <br><br>
            This candlestick is considered as a bearish reversal signal when it 
            occurs at the top of an uptrend, and it is a bullish signal when it occurs 
            at the bottom of a downtrend.<br><br>
            See an example below:
            <img src="img/22.webp"/>
            <img src="img/23.webp"/>
            As you see the smaller body is totally covered by the previous mother 
            candle, don’t bother yourself with the colors, the most important is 
            that the smaller body closes inside of the first bigger candle.<br><br>
            The Harami candle tells us that the market is in an indecision period. 
            In other words, the market is consolidating.<br><br>
            So, buyers and sellers don’t know what to do, and there is no one in 
            control of the market. <br><br>
            When  this  candlestick  pattern  happens  during  an  uptrend  or  a 
            downtrend, it is interpreted as a continuation pattern which gives a 
            good opportunity to join the trend.<br><br>
            And if it is occurred at the top of an uptrend or at the bottom of a 
            downtrend, it is considered as a trend reversal signal. <br><br>
            Look at another example below:
            <img src="img/24.webp"/>
            In the chart above, you can see how the trend direction changes after 
            the  Harami  pattern  formation,  the  first  bullish  harami  pattern 
            occurred at the bottom of a downtrend, sellers were pushing the 
            market lower, suddenly price starts consolidating, and this indicates 
            that the selling power is no longer in control of the market.<br><br>
            The bearish Harami is the opposite of the bullish, this one occurred at 
            the top of an uptrend indicating that buyer’s domination is over and 
            the beginning of a downtrend is possible.<br><br>
            When this pattern is created during an uptrend or a downtrend, it 
            indicates a continuation signal with the direction of the market. <br><br>
            We will study in details how to trade this pattern either as a reversal 
            pattern or as a continuation pattern in the next chapters.</p>

            <h3 style="color: red;">The Tweezers tops and bottoms</h3>
            <p>The tweezers top formation is considered as a bearish reversal pattern 
                seen at the top of an uptrend, and the tweezers bottom formation is 
                interpreted as a  bullish reversal pattern seen at the bottom of  a 
                downtrend.<br><br>
                See the example below:
                <img src="img/25.webp"/>
                The tweezers top formation consists of two candlesticks: 
                The first one is a bullish candlestick followed by a bearish candlestick. 
                And the tweezers bottom formation consists of two candlesticks as 
                well. <br><br>
                The first candle is bearish followed by a bullish candlestick.
                So we can say that the tweezers bottom is the bullish version of the 
                tweezers top.<br><br>
                The tweezers top occurs during an uptrend when buyers push the price 
                higher, this gave us the impression that the market is still going up, but 
                sellers surprised buyers by pushing the market lower and close down 
                the open of the bullish candle. <br><br>
                This price action pattern indicates a bullish trend reversal and we can 
                trade it if we can combine this signal with other technical tools.<br><br>
                The tweezers bottom happens during a downtrend, when sellers push 
                the market lower, we feel that everything is going all right, but the next 
                session price closes above or roughly at the same price of the first 
                bearish candle which indicates that buyers are coming to reverse the 
                market direction. <br><br>
                If this price action happens near a support level, it indicates that a 
                bearish reversal is likely to happen.

                The  chart  above  shows  us  a  tweezers  bottom  that  occurs  in  a 
                downtrend,  the  bears  pushed  the  market  downward  on  the  first 
                session; however, the second session opened where prices closed on 
                the first session and went straight up indicating a reversal buy signal 
                that you can trade if you have other elements that confirm your buying 
                decision.<br><br>
                Don’t  focus  on  the  name  of  a  candlestick,  try  to  understand  the 
                psychology behind its formation, this is the most important.<br><br>
                Because if you can understand why it was formed, you will understand 
                what happened in the market, and you can easily predict the future 
                movement of price.
