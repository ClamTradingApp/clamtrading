    <h3>Time frames and top down analysis</h3>
    <p>As a price action trader, your primary time frame is the 1H, the 4H and 
        the daily.<br><br>
        Price action works on bigger time frames, if you try to trade pin bars 
        or engulfing bars on the 5-minute time frame, you will lose your 
        money, because there is lot of noise on smaller time frames, and the 
        market will generate lot of false signals because of the hard battle 
        between the bears and bulls.<br><br>
        Besides, there is no successful price action trader who focuses on one- 
        time frame to analyze his charts, maybe you have heard of the term 
        top and down analysis which means to begin with bigger time frames 
        to get the big picture, and then you switch to the smaller one to decide 
        whether to buy or to sell the market.<br><br>
        Let’s say you want to trade the 4h chart, you have to look at the weekly 
        chart first, and then the daily chart, if the weekly and the daily charts 
        analysis  align  with  the  4h  chart,  you  can  then  take  your  trading 
        decision. <br><br>
        And if you want to trade the 1H chart, you have to look at the daily 
        chart first. This is a critical step to do as a price action trader, because 
        this will help you avoid low probability trading setups, and it will allow 
        you to stay focused on high probability price action signals.<br><br>
        Through our top down analysis, we always start with the bigger time 
        frame, and we look for to gather the following information:<br><br>
        <strong>-The  most  important  support  and  resistance  levels:</strong> these  areas 
        represent turning points in the market, if you can identify them on the 
        weekly chart, you will know what is going to happen when the price 
        approaches these levels on the 4h chart. <br><br>
        So you will decide either to buy, to sell or to ignore the signals you get 
        from the market.</p>
    <p><strong>-The market structure:</strong> the weekly analysis will help you identify if the 
        market is trending up or down, or it is ranging, or choppy market. In 
        general, you will know what the big investors are doing. And you will 
        try to find a way to follow them on the smaller time frames using my 
        price action strategies.<br><br>
        <strong>-The previous candle:</strong> the last candle on the weekly chart is 
        important, because it tells us what happens during a week, and it 
        provides us with valuable information about the future market move. 
        When you identify these points using the weekly chart, you can now 
        move to the daily chart or the 4h chart and try to gather information 
        such as:<br><br>
        <strong>-The market condition:</strong> what the market is doing on the 4h time 
        frame, is it trending up or down, is it ranging, or is it a choppy 
        market.<br><br>
        <strong> - what are the most important key levels on the 4h or the daily time 
        frame:</strong> this could be support and resistance, supply and demand 
        areas, trend lines….<br><br>
        <strong> -price action signal:</strong> a candlestick patterns that will provide you with 
        a signal to buy or short the market. This could be a pin bar, an 
        engulfing bar or an inside bar…<br><br>
        Let me give you an example to help you understand why it is 
        important to adopt the top down analysis concept in your trading 
        method and what is going to happen if you don’t look at the bigger 
        time frame before switching to your primary chart.<br><br>
        Look at the illustration below:</p>
        <img src="img/42.webp"/>
    <p>As you can see in this weekly chart above, we have gathered two 
        important points that will help us decide what to do on the daily time 
        frame.<br><br>
        The first point is that the market approaches to an important weekly 
        resistance level that will represent a hot point in the market.<br><br>
        The second information is the rejection from this key resistance level, 
        as you can see the price was rejected immediately when it approaches 
        the level, this indicates that there are sellers there and they are willing 
        to short the market. <br><br>
        What confirms our analysis is the formation of the inside bar false 
        breakout patterns that indicates a reversal.<br><br>
        Now let’s switch to the daily time frame to see what is going on in the 
        market:</p>
        <img src="img/43.webp"/>
    <p>On the daily chart, we have a clear pin bar candlestick pattern that 
        indicates a bullish signal.<br><br>
        if you focus just on one-time frame to make your trading decision, 
        You will buy the market, because there is a clear pin bar signal. <br><br>
        But if you analyzed the weekly chart, you would know that there is a 
        very   powerful key level that will stop the market from going up. <br><br>
        So, it’s better to think of selling the market if there is a clear signal 
        rather than to buy it. <br><br>
        Look at what happened next:</p>
    <img src="img/44.webp"/>
    <p>As you can see, the top down analysis works, the pin bar candlestick 
        signal didn’t work, because the weekly resistance level was a powerful 
        turning point that reversed the market direction.<br><br>
        If you want to trade price action based on one-time frame, i highly 
        recommend you to stop trading because you will end up losing your 
        entire trading account, and you will never become a successful trader. 
        Trading counter trends is very profitable as well, but without the top 
        down analysis, you will put yourself in troubles. <br><br>
        Let me give you another example to show how you can trade counter 
        trends using your price action trading setups in combination with the 
        top down analysis concept.</p>
    <img src="img/45.webp"/>
    <p>As you can see in the chart above, price are at a weekly resistance 
        level, buyers were rejected twice from this level which indicates that 
        the market is at a hot a point and it is likely to reverse.<br><br>
        What you can do as a price action trader is to switch to the daily time 
        frame to look for a selling opportunity. <br><br>
        If you can find a price action setup near the weekly resistance level on 
        the daily time frame, this is going to be a high probability setup to take 
        into consideration. <br><br>
        See the example below:</p>
    <img src="img/46.webp"/>
    <p>The daily chart above confirms our weekly analysis, as you can see; 
        there is a clear bearish signal near the weekly resistance level. <br><br>
        The  pin  bar  was  rejected  from  that  level,  and  there  is  also  the 
        formation of an inside bar false breakout. <br><br>
        This is a clear indication of a trend change. <br><br>
        See what happened next:</p>
   <img src="img/47.webp"/>
   <p>The  example  above  shows  that  counter  trend  works  if  it  is  well 
    mastered, it is a contrarian approach that requires experience, so if 
    you are a beginner, i highly recommend you to stick with the trend, try 
    to practice as much as you can the top down analysis concept with the 
    trend, and when you master trading with the trend, you can then move 
    to trade high probability counter trend setups.<br><br>
    There are many approaches used to time the market turns and plan 
    trades, the most of these approaches lead to greater confusion and 
    lack of confidence in the results.<br><br>
    Keeping the analysis simple is most often the best way to go, and top 
    down analysis is one of the easiest approaches that i recommend to 
    master if you want to trade the right way.<br><br>
    What you have to do right now is to open your charts and try to 
    practice what you learnt in this chapter. </p>
    <p>Try to identify the market trend using these techniques. It will be little 
        confusing at the beginning, but with some screen time and practice, 
        you will find it easy to identify the market direction.</p>
