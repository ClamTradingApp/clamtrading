    <h3>History of candlesticks</h3>

        <p>Candlesticks have been around a lot longer than anything similar in the 
        Western world. </p> 
        <p>The Japanese were looking at charts as far back as the 17th century, 
        whereas the earliest known charts in the US appeared in the late 19th 
        century.  </p>
        <p>Rice trading had been established in Japan in 1654, with gold, silver 
        and rape seed oil following soon after. </p>
        <p> Rice  markets  dominated  Japan  at  this  time  and  the  commodity 
        became, it seems, more important than hard currency. </p>
        Munehisa Homma (aka Sokyu Honma), a Japanese rice trader born in 
        the early 1700s, is widely credited as being one of the early exponents 
        of tracking price action.  </p>
        <p> He understood basic supply and demand dynamics, but also identified 
        the fact that emotion played a part in the setting of price. 
        He wanted to track the emotion of the market players, and this work 
        became the basis of candlestick analysis.  </p>
        <p>  He was extremely well respected, to the point of being promoted to 
        Samurai status. </p>
        <p>  The Japanese did an extremely good job of keeping candlesticks quiet 
        from the Western world, right up until the 1980s, when suddenly there 
        was a large cross-pollination of banks and financial institutions around 
        the world.  </p>
        <p>  This is when Westerners suddenly got wind of these mystical charts. 
        Obviously, this  was  also  about  the  time  that  charting  in  general 
        suddenly became a lot easier, due to the widespread use of the PC. </p>

        <p> In  the  late  1980s  several  Western  analysts  became  interested  in 
        candlesticks. In the UK Michael Feeny, who was then head of TA in 
        London for Sumitomo, began using candlesticks in his daily work, and 
        started introducing the ideas to London professionals. </p>

        <p>
            In the December 1989 edition of Futures magazine Steve Nison, who 
            was a technical analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, produced a paper 
            that showed a series of candlestick reversal patterns and explained 
            their predictive powers. <br><br>
            He went on to write a book on the subject, and a fine book it is too. 
            Thank you Messrs Feeny and Nison.<br><br>
            Since then candlesticks have gained in popularity by the year, and 
            these days they seem to be the standard template that most analysts 
            work from.<br><br>
          <h3>  Why candlesticks are important to your trading analysis?</h3>
            -Candlesticks  are  important  to  you trading  analysis  because,  it  is 
            considered as a visual representation of what is going on in the market. 
            By looking at a candlestick, we can get valuable information about the 
            open, high, low and the close of price, which will give us an idea about 
            the price movement.<br><br>
            -Candlesticks are flexible, they can be used alone or in combination 
            with  technical  analysis  tools  such  as  the  moving  averages,  and 
            momentum oscillators, they can be used also with methods such the 
            Dow Theory or the Eliot wave theory. <br><br>
            I personally use candlesticks with support and resistance, trend lines, 
            and other technical tools that you will discover in the next chapters.
            -The human behavior in relation to money is always dominated by 
            fear; greed, and hope, candlestick analysis will help us understand 
            these changing psychological factors by showing us how buyers and 
            sellers interact with each other’s.<br><br>
            -Candlesticks provide more valuable information than bar charts, using 
            them is a win-win situation, because you can get all the trading signals 
            that bar chart generate with the added clarity and additional signals 
            generated by candlesticks.<br><br>
            -Candlesticks are used by most professional traders, banks, and hedge 
            funds, these guys trade millions of dollars every day, they can move 
            the market whenever they want. <br><br>
            They can take your money easily if you don’t understand the game. 
            Even if you can trade one hundred thousand dollars trading account, 
            you can’t move the market; you can’t control what is going in the 
            market.<br><br>
            Using candlestick patterns will help you understand what the big boys 
            are doing, and will show you when to enter, when to exit, and when to 
            stay away from the market.
