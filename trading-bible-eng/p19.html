    <h3>The inside bar candlestick pattern</h3>
    <p>The inside bar candlestick pattern is one of the most powerful chart 
        setup that professional traders look out; however, most traders fail to 
        trade it successfully.<br><br>
        Lack of skills and knowledge and poor education are the major reasons 
        why most price action traders don’t make money trading this Japanese 
        candlestick. <br><br>
        What is an inside bar candlestick pattern?<br><br>
        An inside bar is two candlesticks, the first one is called the mother 
        candle, it is big and large, and the second one is smaller and it is located 
        inside of the mother bar.</p>

    <p>The illustration above shows inside bars at tops and at bottoms, as you 
        can see, the second small bar is completely contained by the first one 
        which is the opposite of the engulfing bar pattern.<br><br>
        The inside bar is seen as a reversal pattern, because it indicates that 
        the market trend is likely to change especially when it is located at tops 
        or bottoms. <br><br>
        It  is  also  considered  as  a  continuation  signal  in  strong  trending 
        markets.<br><br>
        According to Thomas Bulkowski, a successful investor, and trader with 
        over thirty years of market experience:<br><br>
        A bearish inside bar pattern in a bull market can indicates a bearish 
        reversal in about 65% of the time. <br><br>
        And in a bull market, it represents a bullish continuation signal in about 
        52% of the time.</p>
    <p>And a bullish abandoned baby as he call it, is considered a bullish 
        reversal pattern 70% of the time in bull markets, and 55% in bear 
        markets</p>
    <h3 style="color: red;">The psychology behind the pattern formation</h3>
    <p>The inside bar formation indicates a period of consolidation, in case of 
        a bullish trend, it reflects that the bulls are not buying any further on 
        the second day, it is represented by a small black candle on the second 
        day, after a strong uptrend.<br><br>
        And in case of a bearish trend, it means that sellers are not in control 
        of the market any more, it is reflected by a small white candle after a 
        strong downtrend.<br><br>
        Your understanding of the psychology behind this pattern will help you 
        better identify major turning points in the market, and time correctly 
        your entry and exit.<br><br>
        How to trade the inside bar candlestick patterns?<br><br>
        The  inside  bar  can  be  traded  successfully  in  trending  markets 
        particularly if the market is moving strongly.<br><br>
        Because the formation of this price pattern provides you with a great 
        opportunity to join the big move.<br><br>
        This strategy is very simple, you have to identify a strong trend, and 
        wait for the formation of an inside bar pattern in line with the direction 
        of the market.<br><br>
        The formation of this pattern indicates that the market pauses before 
        making its next move; this will allow you to enter the market in the 
        right time and make big profits.<br><br>
        See the illustration below to learn more:</p>
        <img src="img/93.webp"/>
    <p>As it is illustrated above, the market is trending down; the formation 
        of inside bar patterns gave us three opportunities to join the trend.
        If you are used to our trading approach, you will only look for selling 
        opportunities, this way, you are not fighting big institutions and central 
        banks, you are just trading in the direction that is favored by the 
        market.<br><br>
        You can place a sell order after the breakout of the pattern as it is 
        mentioned in the chart above, and your stop loss order should be 
        placed above the mother candle. Your profit target is the next support 
        level. <br><br>
        See another example below:</p>
        <img src="img/94.webp"/>
    <p>From the above chart, we can see how this price action setup work 
        significantly as a continuation pattern, to be honest, you are not going 
        to take all these signals into considerations.<br><br>
        You have to look for significant patterns that form in specific areas in 
        the market such as support and resistance, Fibonacci retracement 
        levels, moving averages, or pivot points.<br><br>
        Don’t worry about that, because we will learn about the important 
        trading tools that we will need to use in combination with inside bar 
        setups to make the best trading decisions</p>
   
        <h3 style="color: red;">How to trade the inside bar breakout with support and resistance </h3>
    <p>Technical analysis can be very complicated if you don’t focus on the 
        most important basics, such as support and resistance levels.<br><br>
        These areas represent a psychological level where the game is played 
        between buyers and sellers, let me give you an example:<br><br>
        If sellers overcome buyers they will push the price below the support 
        level. Some buyers will feel afraid to lose money, because they see that 
        the support level is broken .so, they will get out, and sell the market 
        again to cover their loss.<br><br>
        Other participants will notice that sellers are in control of the market, 
        they will decide to sell the market and help the bears push the price to 
        go down.<br><br>
        As  a  trader,  if  you  have  enough  knowledge  about  support  and 
        resistance levels, when you open your chart, you will notice that the 
        support level is broken, and the bears are in control of the market, this 
        is a good selling opportunity right? But the question is, what is the right 
        time to enter the market?<br><br>
        The inside bar pattern is one of the most reliable price action signal 
        that will give you the right time to enter the market and make big 
        profits.<br><br>
        Once you understand how to use it in combination with these levels, 
        you will get clearly what the market is telling you, and you will make 
        good trading decisions.<br><br>
        See the chart below:</p>
        <img src="img/95.webp"/>
    <p>The illustration below shows how sellers broke the support level, the 
        formation of the inside bar pattern after the breakout of this level 
        signals indecision in the market.<br><br>
        Right now, no one knows if the support level is really broken, if you sell 
        at market immediately after the breakout of this level, you are making 
        an aggressive entry, which is little tricky and dangerous, because the 
        breakout is not confirmed.<br><br>
        But if you are used with trading inside bars and you understand the 
        psychology behind their formations, you will know that the safest 
        entry should be after the breakout of this pattern.<br><br>
        The breakout of this candlestick pattern is a clear confirmation that 
        the market is not still in an indecision period, and sellers are obviously 
        in control of the market. See another example.</p>
        <img src="img/96.webp"/>
    <p>The chart above shows how the market participants interact with 
        these levels, and how the resistance level acts as barrier.
        The  market  has  had  difficulty  rising  above;  this  horizontal  level 
        prevents buyers twice from rising any further. But in the third attempt, 
        buyers broke through the resistance level.<br><br>
        What is interesting is what happened after the breakout, look at the 
        chart again, you will notice that there is a clear inside bar pattern 
        formed over there.<br><br>
        The formation of this price action pattern indicates that the breakout 
        is  not  yet  confirmed,  remember,  an  inside  bar  formation  means 
        indecision and hesitation. So, you have to be careful, and bear in mind 
        that a false breakout scenario is possible.<br><br>
        What will make a difference between you and other traders is your 
        deep understanding of how this pattern works, in this chart above, you 
        will know that the best time to place a buy order should be after the 
        breakout  of  the  inside  bar  pattern  not  after  the  breakout  of  the 
        horizontal level.</p>
    <h3 style="color: red;">Tips on trading the inside bar price action setups</h3>
    <p>1-Trade the bigger time frames <br><br>
        I’m not against trading lower time frames, you can trade this setup on 
        5 minutes time frame using other technical indicators to filter your 
        signals and take just high probability setups.<br><br>
        But you have to be an experienced trader, if you are beginner
        i recommend you to stick with trading this signal in bigger time frames 
        such the daily and the 4-hour time frame.<br><br>
        Trading this setup on lower time frame will increase your chance to 
        overtrade the market and take low probability price action signals. And 
        this is the quickest way to blow up your trading account.<br><br>
        If you focus just on bigger time frames, this will allow you to set and 
        forget  your  trade  instead  of  being  emotionally  controlled  by  the 
        market.<br><br>
        2- Trade the dominant trend <br><br>
        You should start trading inside bars in line with the direction of the 
        market, especially in a strong bullish or bearish trend, but don’t never 
        try to trade it against the trend if you are a newbie.<br><br>
        When you feel like you master trading this pattern with the trend, you 
        can move to trade range bound markets, and counter trends.<br><br>
        3- Trade only from key levels<br><br>
        Remember that not all inside bars are worth your hard-earned money; 
        there are specific locations where this setup works great, so make sure 
        that your signal is located in a key level in the market.<br><br>
        4- Find different factors of confluence <br><br>
        Trading with confluence means combining different signals to make 
        the best trading decision.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p>To trade using this concept you need to look for a point in the market 
        where two or more levels are coming together and wait for an obvious 
        signal to form.<br><br>
        This trading method will give you confidence in your trading approach 
        and it will allow you to avoid over-trading.</p>
