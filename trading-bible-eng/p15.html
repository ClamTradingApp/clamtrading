    <p>A  bullish  engulfing  pattern forms  at  the  end  of  a  downtrend,  it 
        provides a clear signal that the buying pressure has overwhelmed the 
        selling pressure. <br><br>
        In other words, the buyers are now involved.<br><br>
        A bearish engulfing pattern occurs at the end of an uptrend, it is a top 
        trend reversal indicator, it shows that the bulls are no more in control 
        of the market, and the price trend is likely to reverse. <br><br>

    <p>According to Steve Nison, the father of modern candlestick charting, 
        this candle must meet three important criteria to be considered as a 
        reversal pattern:<br><br>
        1-The market is in a clearly definable uptrend or downtrend<br><br>
        2-The engulfing candle comprises of two candlesticks, and the first 
        body is entirely engulfed by the second one.<br><br>
        3- The second real body is the opposite of the first real body.</p>
