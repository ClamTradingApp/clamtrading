    <h3>How to trade trending markets:</h3>
    <p>If you can identify a trending market, it will be easy for you to trade it, 
        if it is a bullish market, you will look for a buying opportunity, because 
        you have to trade with the trend, and if the market is bearish, you have 
        to look for a selling opportunity.<br><br>
        But the question is what is the right time to enter a trending market? 
        Trending markets are characterized by two important moves, the first 
        move is called, the impulsive move, and the second one is called the 
        retracement move.<br><br>
        See the example below to understand what i’m talking about.</p>

    <p>As you can see, the market is making higher highs and higher lows 
        which indicates a bullish market, if you see this market you will think 
        of buying. But as you can see the market is making two different 
        moves, the first move is an impulsive move, and the second one is a 
        pullback or a retracement move. (corrective move)<br><br>
        Professional traders understand how trending markets move; they 
        always buy at the beginning of an impulsive move and take profits at 
        the end of it. <br><br>
        This is the reason why the market makes an impulsive move in the 
        direction of the trend and retraces before it makes another impulsive 
        move.<br><br>
        If you are aware of how trending markets move, you will know that the 
        best place to buy is at the beginning of an impulsive move, traders who 
        buy an uptrend market at the beginning of a retracement move, they 
        got caught by professional traders, and they don’t understand why the 
        market hint their stop loss before moving in the predicted direction. 
        See another example of a bearish trend.</p>

    <p>The illustration above shows a downtrend market, as you can see the 
        best trading decision is to sell the market at the beginning of an 
        impulsive move. <br><br>
        If you try to sell in the retracement move, you will be trapped by 
        professional traders, and you will lose your trade.<br><br>
        Now we know how to identify downtrends and uptrends, and how to 
        differentiate between an impulsive move, and a retracement move. 
        This is very important for you as a price action trader to know.<br><br>
        BUT the most important question is how to identify the beginning of 
        the  impulsive  move  to  enter  the  market  in  the  right  time  with 
        professional traders, and avoid being trapped by the retracement 
        move?<br><br>
        To predict the beginning of the impulsive move in a trending market, 
        you have to master drawing support and resistance levels.<br><br>
        So, what are support and resistance levels and how to draw them on 
        our charts? this is what we will see in the next chapter.</p>
