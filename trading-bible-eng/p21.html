    <h3>Trades Examples</h3>
    <p>In this section, i will show you different trades examples to help you 
        understand how to trade the market using all the strategies discussed 
        in the previous sections. See the first example below:</p>
    <img src="img/105.webp"/>
    <p>As you can see in the chart above, the market is trending down, so as 
        a price action trader, i will try to follow the trend and look for powerful 
        signals at the most powerful key levels.<br><br>
        The first signal we got is a pin bar that was rejected from a support 
        level that becomes resistance.<br><br>
        The second factor that support our decision to sell the market is the 
        rejection of the pin from the 50% Fibonacci retracement.<br><br>
        </p>
    <p>The third factor that encourages us to take this signal is the rejection 
        of the pin bar from the 21 moving average that was acting as a dynamic 
        resistance level.<br><br>
        The second signal was an engulfing bar candlestick pattern, as you can 
        see in the chart, this candlestick pattern was formed at a resistance 
        level in line with the direction of the market.<br><br>
        This is how you can trade trending markets using our price action 
        signals. It’s simple just identify the trend, and the key levels, it can be 
        a support or resistance level, a 21 moving averages, or 50% and 61% 
        Fibonacci retracement.<br><br>
        Wait for a pin bar, an engulfing bar, an inside bar, or an inside bar false 
        breakout to form near these levels in line with the direction of the 
        market, and then execute your trade. It’s not complicated.<br><br>
        See another example below:</p>
    <img src="img/106.webp"/>
    <p>As you can see in the chart above the market is trading horizontally 
        between the support and the resistance level.<br><br>
        This market is completely different from trending markets, and the 
        strategy to trade it must different as well.<br><br>
        In  ranging  markets,  we  trade  from  the  boundaries,  i  mean  from 
        support and resistance levels, don’t never try to trade inside the range. 
        In the chart above, we had two powerful signals, the first signal was a 
        pin bar that was strongly rejected from the resistance level, and the 
        second signal was an inside bar formed near the support level.<br><br>
        See another chart below:</p>
        <img src="img/107.webp"/>
    <p>As you can see in the chart above, there are three powerful pin bar 
        signals. When the market approaches the 21 moving average that acts 
        as a resistance level, sellers reject buyers, and form a pin bar that gives 
        us a good entry point.</p>
    <h3 style="color: red;">Money management strategies</h3>
    <p>Now you have the strategies, you know how to analyze the market, 
        you know when to buy, when to sell, and when to exit, you know also 
        when to stay away from the market. <br><br>
        This is important for you as a trader to know, but you are still missing 
        the key to the castle. The money management plan.<br><br>
        The most important thing that traders don’t talk about is the money 
        management. This is what makes a difference between successful 
        traders and losers.<br><br>
        If you trade without a money management plan, you are just wasting 
        your time and money. Because nothing is going to work for you, even 
        if you have the most powerful trading system in the world.<br><br>
        Most traders focus on how to enter the market, they spend months 
        and years looking for the right system. i don’t want you to think like 
        them, you should think differently if you want to become a successful 
        trader.<br><br>
        Money management: Position sizing<br><br>
        One of the most important component of money management is <br><br>
        position sizing, what i mean by position sizing is the number of lots you 
        are risking per trade. <br><br>
        All forex brokers now offer mini lots as the default position size. The 
        smallest value for a mini lot is approximately 1$. <br><br>
        There  are  forex  brokers  that  offer  10  cents  for  a  mini  lot  which 
        represent an opportunity for traders who don’t have bigger accounts, 
        they can begin with 250$, and they still have chance to grow it.<br><br>
        When it comes to position sizing, you should think in terms of dollars 
        instead of pips. Let’s say you are trading 3 mini lots of CAD/USA, this 
        means you bought or sold 30.000 worth of us dollars.</p>
    <p>If the market moves in your favor, you will win an amount of money 
        equal to 3$ per pip. If you make 20 pips, you would have profited 60$. 
        Let’s break it down, 1standard lot is worth about 10$ per pip. And 
        1mini lot is worth about 1$ per pip, and 1 micro lot is equal to 10 cents. 
        If you open a mini trading account, you should think in term of the 
        dollars risked instead of pips. <br><br>
        Let’s say you put 50 pips stop loss and 100 pips as a profit target. This 
        means that if the market hits your stop loss you will lose 50 pips which 
        is 50$, and if the market hit the profit target, you will win 100$.
        The size of your position depends on whether you have a standard or 
        a mini account, and how many lots you are trading. This information is 
        important to you because this will help you know how much money 
        you risk on each trade.<br><br>
        The risk to reward ratio<br><br>
        The risk to reward ratio concept is what will make you a winner in the 
        long run. Before you enter any trade, you have to know how much 
        money you will win if the market goes in your favor, and how much 
        money you will lose if the market goes against you.<br><br>
        Don’t never enter a trade in which the profit is less than the amount 
        of money you risked. <br><br>
        If you will risk 100$ for example, your profit target should be at least 
        200$, this is a risk to reward ratio of 1:2.<br><br>
        Let’s suppose that you took 10 trades with 1:2 risks to reward ratio. In 
        every trade you risk 100$.<br><br>
        You won 5trades, and you lost 5 trades. So you will lose 500$.but you 
        will win 1000$.so the benefits is 500$.<br><br>
        This is the power of the risk to reward ratio, you shouldn’t think that 
        you have to win all your trades to become a successful trader. If you 
        can take the advantage of the risk to reward ratio, you will always be 
        profitable.</p>
    <h3 style="color: red;">The importance of a Stop loss</h3>
    <p>All good methodologies use stops. A protective stop loss is an order to 
        exit a long or short position when prices move against you to specified 
        price.<br><br>
        The stop loss insures against a usually large loss and has to be used in 
        one way or another. <br><br>
        An initial stop loss can be placed with your order on the trading 
        platform; the trade will be closed, automatically when if the stop loss 
        is hit.<br><br>
        This type of stop loss will allow you to execute your trade and go spend 
        time with your family or friends, this will help you to trade out of your 
        emotion, because you know how much money you will lose if the 
        market didn’t go in your direction.<br><br>
        Lot of traders use mental stops, when they enter a trade, they don’t 
        place a stop loss, because they think that the broker will hit their stop 
        loss which is not true. <br><br>
        The  reason  behind  using  mental  stop  is  the  human  psychology, 
        humans hate to lose money. And if you don’t accept losing money as 
        a part of the game, you will never make money in the market.<br><br>
        Don’t never think of using mental stops, because you can’t control the 
        market, you can’t be sure that the market will do this or that. 
        Before you enter a trade, calculate how much you may win, and how 
        much you may lose. Place your stop loss order. And your profit target. 
        And forget about your trade.<br><br>
       <strong>Don’t ever risk money that you can’t afford to lose</strong> <br><br>
        I got lot of questions from traders asking me about how much money 
        they need to start trading. First of all, you have to take trading as a 
        business. You can make money in this business and you can lose it as 
        well. <br><br>
        The amount of money that you need to start trading depends on the 
        amount of money that you can afford to lose. Don’t ever borrow 
        money or risk big amounts of money that you can’t afford to lose.
        Because trading is all about emotions, if you trade and you are afraid 
        to lose your trading account, you will fail in this business. Because you 
        will be controlled by your emotion, and this will affect your trading 
        decisions. <br><br>
        You will not be able to follow your trading strategy, and you will 
        certainly fail.<br><br>
        The best thing to do is to start small, try to get as much experience as 
        you can, and build slowly your trading account. This is how successful 
        traders become successful.</p>
