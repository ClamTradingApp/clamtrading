    <h3>Support and Resistance levels</h3>
    <p>Support and resistance are proven areas where buyers and sellers find 
        some of equilibrium, they are major turning points in the market.<br><br>
        Support and resistance levels are formed when price reverses and 
        change  direction,  and  price  will  often  respect  these  support  and 
        resistance levels, in other words, they tend to contain price movement 
        until of course price breaks through them.<br><br>
        In trending markets, support and resistance are formed from swing 
        points. in an uptrend the previous swing point acts as a support level, 
        and in a downtrend the old swing point acts as a resistance level. 
        See the example below to learn more</p>

    <p>The illustration above shows how the previous swing point acts as a 
        support level after the breakout.<br><br>
        When  the  market  makes  the  retracement  move  it  respects  the 
        previous swing point (support level) which will represent the beginning 
        of another impulsive move. <br><br>
        As you  can  see,  when the  market tests  the previous swing  point 
        (support level) it goes up again.
        By drawing a support level in an uptrend market, we can predict when 
        the next impulsive move will take place. <br><br>
        Letâ€™s see another example of a downtrend market.</p>
        <img src="img/34.webp"/>
        <p>The illustration above shows us how the market respects resistance 
            levels,  when  price  approach  the  previous  swing  point,  (resistance 
            level). </p>
        <p>The market makes an impulsive move. If you understand how price 
            action act in a trending market, you will predict with high accuracy 
            when the next impulsive move will begin.<br><br>
            Another way to catch the beginning of an impulsive move is by drawing 
            trend lines. <br><br>
            This is another technical skill that you have to learn if you want to 
            identify key linear support and resistance level.<br><br>
            Let me explain you first what do trend lines mean?<br><br>
            Quite often when the market is on the move making new swing highs 
            and lows, price will tend to respect a linear level which is identified as 
            a trend line. <br><br>
            Bullish markets will tend to create a linear support level, and bearish 
            markets will form a linear resistance level.</p>
