    <h3>The Ranging Market</h3>
    <p>Ranging markets are pretty straight forward, they are often called 
        sideways markets, because their neutral nature makes them appear to 
        drift to the right, horizontally.<br><br>
        When the market makes a series of higher highs and higher lows, we 
        can say that the market is trending up. <br><br>
        But when it stops making these consecutive peaks, we say that the 
        market is ranging.<br><br>
        A ranging market moves in a horizontal form, where buyers and sellers 
        just keep knocking price back and forth between the support and the 
        resistance level. <br><br>
        See the example below:</p>
        <img src="img/37.webp"/>
        <p>The chart above shows a ranging market, as you can see, the price is 
            bouncing between horizontal support and resistance level.<br><br>
            The difference between trending markets and ranging markets is that 
            trending markets tend to move by forming a pattern of higher high and 
            higher lows in case of an uptrend, and higher low and lower low in case 
            of a downtrend.</p>

        <p>But ranging markets tend to move horizontally between key support 
            and resistance levels.<br><br>
            Your understanding of the difference between the both markets will 
            help you better use the right price action strategies in the right market 
            conditions.<br><br>
            Trading ranging markets is completely different from trading trending 
            markets, because when the market is ranging, it creates equilibrium, 
            buyers are equal to sellers, and there is no one in control.<br><br>
            This will generally continue until the range structures broke out , and 
            a trending condition start to organize. <br><br>
            The best buying and selling opportunities occur at key support and 
            resistance levels.<br><br>
            There are three ways to trade ranging markets, i’m not going to go into 
            details, because what i want you to get here is the skill to look at your 
            charts and decide whether the market is trending or ranging. <br><br>
            In the next chapters i will go into details and i will give the trading 
            tactics and strategies that you will use to trade trending or ranging 
            markets.<br><br>
            If  you  can’t  differentiate  between  ranging  markets  and  trending 
            markets, you will not know how to use these price action strategies.
            The  first  way  to  trade  ranging  markets is  by  waiting  for  price  to 
            approach support or resistance level then you can buy at key support 
            level and sell at key resistance level. <br><br>
            See the example below:</p>
     <img src="img/38.webp"/>
     <p>As you can see, the market is moving horizontally, in this case the best 
        buying opportunities occur at the support level. <br><br>
        And the best selling opportunities occur at the resistance level. <br><br>
        The  second  way  of  trading  ranging  markets  is  by  waiting  for  the 
        breakout from either the support level or the resistance level.<br><br>
        When the market is ranging, no one knows what is going to happen, 
        we don’t know who is going to be in control of the market, this is why 
        you have to pay attention to the boundaries, but when one of the 
        players decide to take control of the market, we will see a breakout of 
        the support or the resistance level. <br><br>
        The breakout means that the ranging period is over, and the beginning 
        of a new trend will take place... <br><br>
        See the example below:</p>
    <img src="img/39.webp"/>
    <p>As you can see the market was trading between support and resistance 
        levels, and suddenly the price broke out of the resistance level, this 
        indicates that the beginning of a trend is likely to happen. <br><br>
        So the best way to enter is after the breakout.<br><br>
        It’s important to remember that range boundaries are often overshot, 
        giving the illusion a breakout is occurring, this can be very deceptive, 
        and it does trap a lot of traders who positioned into the breakout.
        The third way to trade ranging markets is to wait for a pullback after 
        the breakout of the support or the resistance level. <br><br>
        The pullback is another chance to join the trend for traders who didn’t 
        enter in the breakout.<br><br>
        See the example below:</p>
        <img src="img/40.webp"/>
    <p>As you can see in the chart above, the market was ranging, price breaks 
        out of the resistance level to indicate the end of the ranging period, 
        and the beginning of a new trend. <br><br>
        After the breakout, the market comes back to retest the resistance 
        level that becomes support before it goes up.<br><br>
        The pullback is your second chance to join the buyers if you miss the 
        breakout. <br><br>
        But Pullbacks don’t always occur after every breakout, when it occurs, 
        it represents a great opportunity with a good risk to reward ratio. 
        What  you  have  to  remember  is  that  a  ranging  market  moves 
        horizontally between the support and the resistance level. <br><br>
        These are the key levels that you have to focus on. The breakout of the 
        support or the resistance level indicates that the ranging period is 
        over, so you have to make sure that the breakout is real to join the 
        new trend safely.</p>
    <p>If you miss the breakout, wait for the pullback. when it occurs, don’t 
        hesitate to enter the market.<br><br>
        When you are trading ranging markets, always make sure that the 
        market  is  worth  trading,  if  you  feel  like  you  can’t  identify  the 
        boundaries (support and resistance). this is a clear indication of a 
        choppy market.<br><br>
        In Forex, choppy markets are those which have no clear directions, 
        when you open your chart, and you find a lot of noise, you can’t even 
        decide if the market is ranging, or trending. <br><br>
        You have to know that you are watching a choppy market. This type of 
        markets can make you feel very emotional and doubt your trading 
        strategies as it starts to drop in performance.<br><br>
        The best way to determine if a market is choppy is just by zooming out 
        on the daily chart and taking in the bigger picture. <br><br>
        After some training, screen time and experience, you will easily be able 
        to identify if a market is ranging or it is a choppy market.<br><br>
        Here is a good example of a choppy chart that is not worth trading.</p>
    <img src="img/41.webp"/>
    <p>Notice in the chart above, the price action in the highlighted area is 
        very choppy, and it is moving sideways in a very small tight range. This 
        is a sign of a choppy market that you should stay away from.<br><br>
        If a market is choppy, in my opinion, it is not worth trading, if you try 
        to trade it, you will give back your profits shortly after big winners, 
        because markets often consolidate after making big moves.</p>
