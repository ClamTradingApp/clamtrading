    <h3>How to trade the engulfing bar price action signals?</h3>
    <p>To trade profitably this chart candlestick pattern, you need to respect 
        three important elements:<br><br>
        <strong>>1-The trend:</strong<br><br>
        If you look at any chart, you will notice that there are times where the 
        market is moving clearly in one direction, and times where it is moving 
        sideways. <br><br>
        To be honest, trading the engulfing bar pattern with the trend is the 
        easiest way to make money in the market.<br><br>
        You don’t need to be highly knowledgeable about technical analysis to 
        determine wither the market is trending or not. <br><br>
        Make it stupid simple, if the market is making series of higher highs 
        and higher lows it is about an uptrend market, and if it is making series 
        of lower highs and lower lows it is simply about a downtrend market.</p>

    <p>The illustration above shows a clear uptrend, you don’t need to use an 
        indicator to determine whether the market is trending or not, just look 
        at your chart, and try to apply the concept of higher highs and higher 
        lows and vice versa.<br><br>
        When you are analyzing your charts, bear in mind that the markets 
        move in trends, and trading with the trend is the most important 
        element in your technical analysis, there’s no more important than the 
        trend, don’t never try to fight it, or to control it, otherwise you will pay 
        expensively for trying.<br><br>
        You can’t make money under any market conditions no matter how 
        powerful is you’re trading system, you have to be patient enough, and 
        let the market tell you which direction is going to take.<br><br>
        Successful traders say, the trend is your friend, and if you want to 
        master trading the engulfing bar pattern, your first rule is to follow the 
        market direction, in other words, the trend should be your best friend.<br><br>
       <strong>2-The level:</strong> <br><br>
        When you find a clearly definable uptrend or downtrend, the next step 
        is to identify the most important levels in the market. i mean the most 
        powerful support and resistance.<br><br>
        If prices test a support level and stop, this is an indication that buyers 
        are  there,  this  area  is  watched  by  all  participants  in  the  market, 
        because it represents a great buying opportunity.<br><br>
        Conversely, if prices test a resistance level and stop in an uptrend, this 
        is a clear signal that selling strength is in the market.<br><br>
        The example below shows how the market participants interact with 
        support and resistance levels:</p>
        <img src="img/74.webp"/>
    <p>These levels take different forms such as: trend lines, channels, flags, 
        triangles… and your ability to identify them in your chart will help you 
        find better price levels in the market.<br><br>
        In trending markets, when prices pass through resistance level, that 
        resistance  could  become  support;  see  the  illustration  below  to 
        understand how to trade the engulfing bar pattern with support and 
        resistance in a bullish or a bearish trend:</p>
        <img src="img/75.webp"/>
    <p>There are other technical tools that can help us find the best levels in 
        the market such as: supply and demand areas, moving averages, and 
        Fibonacci retracement ratios.<br><br>
       <strong> 3-The signal:</strong><br><br>
        The signal here is an engulfing bar pattern; you can apply the same 
        rules when trading the inside bar candlestick pattern
        Your ability to identify an engulfing candlestick at a key level in a clear 
        uptrend or downtrend will greatly enhance the probabilities of making 
        a wining trade. <br><br>
