    <h3>How to trade the engulfing bar in sideways markets?</h3>
    <p>One of the most difficult markets to predict can be the sideways and 
        ranging markets, i always recommend traders to focus on trading 
        trending markets, but the problem is that the markets spend more 
        than 70 % of their time in ranging motion.<br><br>
        If you focus just on trending markets, you will probably leave lot of 
        money on the table, this is the reason why learning how to approach 
        range bound market is a must if you want to make decent living trading 
        financial markets.</p>
        <h4>What is a range-bound market?</h4>
    <p>When the market stop making higher highs and higher lows in case of 
        an uptrend or lower highs and lower lows in case of a downtrend, the 
        price starts acting between specific high price and low price. 
        This is a clear signal that the market is ranging and no longer trending. 
        See the illustration below:</p>
    <img src="img/83.webp"/>
    <p>As you see in the example above, the market is trendless, it is trading 
        between horizontal support and resistance, and you can’t apply the 
        same techniques that you use in trending market to trade engulfing 
        bar patterns in range bound markets.</p>
    <p>Let me give you an example, when you are driving your car, you don’t 
        always drive the same way, if you are driving downtown, you try to 
        drive slowly, because you know that driving fast can put your life or 
        other’s life in danger<br><br>
        But when you are driving in a highway, you’re driving style changes 
        completely, because you know that you can drive fast. So, you always 
        try to adapt your driving style to the appropriate situation.<br><br>
        You have to do the same thing when you are trading the engulfing bar 
        pattern, because all price action strategies we discussed before will 
        not work in range bound markets, and you have to use the right 
        techniques that fit these market conditions.<br><br>
        Before talking about the right way to trade trendless markets, you 
        have to be selective about trading range bound markets to protect 
        your trading account, because not all sideways markets are worth 
        trading. You have to know how to differentiate between sideways and 
        choppy markets.<br><br>
        See the illustration below about choppy markets:</p>
        <img src="img/84.webp"/>
    <p>As it is illustrated above, the market trades in a crazy way, we can’t 
        identify major support levels and resistance. You have to stay away 
        from these types of markets, otherwise, you will definitively damage 
        your trading account.<br><br>
        Trading the engulfing bar candle in range bound market is very simple, 
        the first strategy is going to be about trading this price action pattern 
        from major support and resistance levels like we see below:</p>
    <p>The second strategy is to trade the breakout of the range or to wait for 
        the pullback. See the illustration below :</p>
        <img src="img/85.webp"/>
    <p>The third strategy is to trade the false breakout of the major support 
        or resistance level.</p>
    <p>False breakouts are one of the most powerful price action strategies, 
        it occurs in all types of markets, and if you know how to use it in 
        combination with the engulfing bar pattern in a major support level or 
        resistance, you will make money in the market, because you will buy 
        intelligently the bottoms and sell the tops. <br><br>
        See the illustration below:</p>
        <img src="img/86.webp"/>
    <h3 style="color: red;">Trading the engulfing bar with supply and demand zones?</h3>
    <p>Supply  and  demand  areas  are  more  powerful  than  support  and 
        resistance, it is the place where banks and institutions are buying and 
        selling in the market, if you can identify these turning points, you will 
        make a difference in your trading account.<br><br>
        To  trade  the  engulfing  bar  pattern  successfully  with  supply  and 
        demand areas, you have to be able to identify quality supply and 
        demand levels on a chart, according to my experience; there are three 
        factors that define quality supply and demand areas:<br><br>
        1-The strength of the move:<br><br>
        Pay more attention to the way the price leaves the zone, if the market 
        leaves the area quickly, this is an indication that banks and institutions 
        are there.<br><br>
        2-Good profit zone:<br><br>
        You have to make sure that the level provides a good risk/reward.<br><br>
        3-Bigger time frames:<br><br>
        The daily and 4-hour supply and demand areas are the most powerful 
        zones in the market.<br><br>
        The chart below shows a quality supply area, as you can see the move 
        was very strong, and that indicates that banks and institutions were 
        there. <br><br>
        The formation of an engulfing bar was a clear signal that the bears are 
        still willing to sell from the same price level.</p>
        <img src="img/87.webp"/>
    <p>See another example of these areas:</p>
    <img src="img/88.webp"/>
    <p>I think that it’s not complicated to identify these zones, because they 
        are characterized by strong moves. The secret behind supply and 
        demand areas is that big players put their pending orders there, when 
        the market approaches these zones, we see a crazy move from these 
        levels. </p>
    <p>If  you  can  combine  trading  supply  and  demand  areas  with  the 
        engulfing bar price action signal, you will increase your chances to 
        make money as a trader.</p>
    <h3 style="color: red;">Money management trading rules</h3>
    <p>So far you have learnt how to identify high probability setups in the 
        market; this doesn’t mean that all engulfing bar patterns are worth 
        trading.<br><br>
        Price action signals with low risk /reward ratios should be ignored. 
        Once the criteria for a high probability setup are in place, there is no 
        more analysis to be made, just make sure your trade has a potential of 
        2:1 risk to reward ratio. <br><br>
        I mean that the amount of money you will win has to be twice the 
        amount of money you will risk or more. <br><br>
        See an example below:</p>
        <img src="img/89.webp"/>
    <p>As you can see all the conditions were in place to take a buying order, 
        the market was ranging, as we discussed before, major demand and 
        supply zones are the best price levels in sideways markets.<br><br>
        The formation of an engulfing bar in the demand area is a good trading 
        opportunity, but you have to look at the risk /reward to make sure that 
        the trade respects your money management’s rules.<br><br>
        This trade has 3:1 risk to reward which increases your chances to be 
        winner in the long term, because if you risk 200 dollars in this trade, 
        you are likely to win 600 dollars. It is very important to calculate your 
        risk to reward ratio before taking any single trade.<br><br>
      <strong>Case study</strong>  <br><br>
        Imagine you take 10 trades with 3:1 risk /reward on each single trade, 
        I mean when you win you get 600 dollars, and when the market goes 
        against you, you lose 200 dollars.<br><br>
        Let’s suppose you lost 7 trades and you won just 3 trades. Let’s do the 
        math to know if you are winner or loser.<br><br>
        Seven losing trades will cost you 1400 dollars, and 3 wining trades will 
        make you 1800 dollars. <br><br>
        As you see you lost seven trades, but you are still making money. This 
        is the magic of money management.<br><br>
        The entry and exit strategy<br><br>
        Don’t try to be smarter than the rest of traders, keep it simple, you 
        know what you are looking for, when you identify an engulfing bar 
        pattern, and you think all conditions are in place to execute your trade. 
        Take an order immediately after the price action signal forms, put your 
        stop loss below the candlestick pattern, and look at simply the chart to 
        find the next support or resistance level, this is going to be your profit 
        target.<br><br>
        See the illustration below:
        <img src="img/90.webp"/>
    </p>
    <p>When you set your protective stop and your target, don’t never look 
        back, let the market tell you if you are wrong or right. This will help 
        you trade successfully out of your emotions.<br><br>
        If the market goes against you, you will not feel good, it’s normal, 
        losing money can be emotionally painful, it is our human nature, 
        nobody wants to lose, especially when it is about money, in the trading 
        environment, you have to think differently, and accept the fact that 
        losing is a part of the game.<br><br>
        Studies have shown that successful traders don’t risk more than 2% of 
        their equity on each single trade.<br><br>
        If you are beginner, don’t risk more than 1%. Don’t risk money you 
        can’t afford on a single trade even if the engulfing bar pattern you 
        identify indicates a high probability signal.<br><br>
        No matter how smart you are, you have to think always in term of 
        probabilities, bear in mind that you can experience series of losing 
        trades, and if you risk too much money, you will not survive longer.</p>
